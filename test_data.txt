But for kids, exercise means playing and being physically active. Kids exercise when they have gym class at school, during recess, at dance class or soccer practice, while riding bikes, or when playing tag. The Many Benefits of Exercise Everyone can benefit from regular exercise. Active kids will have: stronger muscles and bones leaner bodies less risk of becoming overweight a lower chance of getting type 2 diabetes lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels a better outlook on life Besides enjoying the health benefits of regular exercise, fit kids sleep better. Exercise improves school performance and makes kids less likely to develop depression. Kids who exercise regularly are also better able to handle physical and emotional challenges — from running to catch a bus to studying for a test. The 3 Elements of Fitness If you've ever watched kids on a playground, you've seen the 3 elements of fitness in action when they: run away from the kid who's "it" (endurance) cross the monkey bars (strength) bend down to tie their shoes (flexibility) Parents should encourage their kids to do a variety of activities so that they can work on all these. Endurance develops when kids regularly get aerobicactivity. During aerobic exercise, large muscles are moving, the heart beats faster, and a person breathes harder. Aerobic activity strengthens the heart and improves the body's ability to deliver oxygen to all its cells.

 Aerobic exercise can be fun for both adults and kids. Aerobic activities include: basketball bicycling ice skating inline skating soccer swimming tennis walking jogging running Improving strength doesn't have to mean lifting weights. Instead, kids can do push-ups, stomach crunches, pull-ups, and other exercises to help tone and strengthen muscles. They also improve their strength when they climb, do a handstand, or wrestle. Muscle strengthening and aerobic exercises like running, jumping, and hopping, also help build strong bones. Stretching exercises help improve flexibility, allowing muscles and joints to bend and move easily through their full range of motion. Kids get chances every day to stretch when they reach for a toy, practice a split, or do a cartwheel. Dance, yoga, and martial arts, like karate, are examples of flexibility activities. The Sedentary Problem Kids and teens sit around a lot more than they used to. They spend hours every day in front of screens (TVs, smartphones, computers, tablets, and gaming systems). Too much screen time and not enough physical activity can add up to unwanted weight gain. One of the best ways to get kids to be more active is to limit the amount of time spent in sedentary activities, especially watching TV and using phones. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that parents: Put limits on the time spent using media, which includes TV, social media, and video games. Media should not take the place of getting enough sleep and being active. Limit screen time to 1 hour a day or less for children 2 to 5 years old. Discourage any screen time, except video-chatting, for kids younger than 18 months. Choose high-quality programming and watch it with your kids to help them understand what they're seeing. Keep TVs, computers, tablets, phones, and video games out of children's bedrooms. Turn off screens during mealtimes. How Much Exercise Is Enough? Parents and caregivers can help ensure that kids are active every day. In its Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends: for school-age kids and teens (6 through 17 years): 60 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily. This should include muscle-strengthening and bone-strengthening activities at least 3 days a week. for preschoolers: active playing throughout the day. A set amount of time hasn't been well defined, but a reasonable target could be 3 hours each day of light, moderate, and vigorous activities. These should include unstructured active free play and planned, adult-led physical activity. Children under age 3 were not included in these guidelines, but exercise guidelines from Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom recommend toddlers be active at least 3 hours throughout the day. This should include light activity, active play, and energetic movement, like hopping, running, and jumping. Young children should not be inactive for long periods of time — no more than 1 hour unless they're sleeping. And school-age kids should not be inactive for periods longer than 2 hours. Raising Fit Kids To help keep kids fit and active: Help your kids do a variety of fun age-appropriate activities. Set a regular schedule for physical activity. Make being active a part of daily life, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator. Embrace a healthier lifestyle yourself, so you'll be a good role model for your family.

It's the miracle cure we've all been waiting for.It can reduce your risk of major illnesses, such as coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and cancer and lower your risk of early death by up to 30%.It's free, easy to take, has an immediate effect and you don't need a GP to get some. Its name? Exercise.Check physical activity guidelines for:children (under 5 years)children and young people (5 to 18 years)exercise (adults 19 to 64 years)older adults (65 years and over)Exercise is the miracle cure we've always had, but for too long we've neglected to take our recommended dose. Our health is now suffering as a consequence.This is no snake oil. Whatever your age, there's strong scientific evidence that being physically active can help you lead a healthier and happier life.People who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing many long-term (chronic) conditions, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and some cancers.Research shows that physical activity can also boost self-esteem, mood, sleep quality and energy, as well as reducing your risk of stress, clinical depression, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Health benefitsGiven the overwhelming evidence, it seems obvious that we should all be physically active. It's essential if you want to live a healthy and fulfilling life into old age.It's medically proven that people who do regular physical activity have lower risk of:coronary heart disease and stroketype 2 diabetesbowel cancerbreast cancer in womenearly deathosteoarthritiship fracturefalls (among older adults)depressiondementia What counts?To stay healthy, the UK Chief Medical Officers' Physical Activity Guidelines, on GOV.UK, state that adults should try to be active every day and aim to do at least 150 minutes of physical activity over a week, through a variety of activities.For most people, the easiest way to get moving is to make activity part of everyday life, like walking for health or cycling instead of using the car to get around. However, the more you do, the better, and taking part in activities such as sports and exercise will make you even healthier.For any type of activity to benefit your health, you need to be moving quick enough to raise your heart rate, breathe faster and feel warmer. This level of effort is called moderate intensity activity. If you're working at a moderate intensity you should still be able to talk but you won't be able to sing the words to a song.An activity where you have to work even harder is called vigorous intensity activity. There is substantial evidence that vigorous activity can bring health benefits over and above that of moderate activity. You can tell when it's vigorous activity because you're breathing hard and fast, and your heart rate has gone up quite a bit. If you're working at this level, you won't be able to say more than a few words without pausing for a breath. Video: Keep healthy with 150 minutes of exercise a week In this video people describe what exercise they do, including cycling, running and swimming.

This is why it is saying that: "if I listen, I forget,if I see, I remember and if I do, I understand".The saying signifies that pupil excel in on opportunity of doing things for themselves because of proper sense perception, while only exhibition of display of things to them during teaching is skill productive, the so called chalk and talk method; proves to be no use at all, this is the important about teaching learning materials.NEED AND IMPORTANCE OF TEACHING LEARNING MATERIALS IN TEACHING AT PRIMARY LEVEL:Teaching Learning Materials to the teachers and the learners aims to provide necessary skills and knowledge along with the inculcation of proper interests and attitudes among them for the effective utilization of the audio-visual aid material and equipments in the process of teaching and learning. The need and importance of imparting Teaching Learning material education to the teachers as well as, students actually rest with the multimensional applicability and purposes that can be served throughvarious types of Teaching Learning Materials.IJSER © 2013h ttp://www.ijser.orgInternational Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research Volume 4, Issue 2, February-2013 7ISSN 2229-55181. Clarity of the subject matterTeaching Learning Materials in Science are helpful in bringing clarity to the difficult and abstract concept and phenomena related to various branches of science. Instead of striving hard with the verbal experiences or explanations. If the teacher makes use of some appropriate aid material, he can make the things more clear and meaningful to his students regarding any subject. For example, if while explaining the construction and working system of the cycle pump, water pump, eye, ear etc, a teacher makes use of some appropriate aid materials in the form of charts, models, photographs he can make the things more clear and meaningful to his students.2. Helpful in the positive transfer of learning and trainingWhat is learned by the students in different subjects at one time may be said to be meaningful only if it can be utilized by them in their inter-related concepts with other subjects or meeting their day to day needs and solving the problems of their life use of Teaching Learning Materials help in this direction by making possible the appropriate positive transfer to learning and training from one situation to another.3. Effective use of Teaching Learning Material sensesIn any scheme of teaching and learning the sensory impressions play the key role and that is why senses are usually termed as the gateway of knowledge. The use of teaching learning materials in the process of education provide valuable opportunities to the learners to make use of their five sense organs i.e., eye, ear, nose, tongue and skinfor gaining valuable knowledge and information.IJSER © 2013h ttp://www.ijser.orgInternational Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research Volume 4, Issue 2, February-2013 8ISSN 2229-55184. Helpful in developing interest and attentionInterest as well as an attention are said to be the key factors in the process of teaching and learning. Teaching Learning Materials help in removing the boredom and monotony of the classroom by adding variety to the classroom activities. They also prove a very good attention in catching device. The students take interest in listening and watching the things and events told that shows through these aids and in this way a suitable learning environment involving the interest and attention of the pupils can be properly created through the use of teaching learning materials.5. A good substitute for direct experiencesThe root of all understanding thinking and attitude formation lies in real experiences and that is why experience is said to be the greatest teacher. Out of the two types of experiences, direct and indirect, the former has no parallel. However, while teaching in the classroom it is not always possible to provide the first hand direct experiences to the students especially in the situations when the objects are too big, too small, too far in terms of distance or time, too fast or too slow to be captured for classroom study. In such a situation, Teaching Learning Materials provide a good substitute for real objects or phenomenon for gaining the meaningful experiences as realistic as possible.6. 

Helpful in reducing evil effects of verbalismEffective learning depends upon effective communications language may play a key part in such communication but may also generate some serious problems. Commenting upon the value and evil effects on this type ofcommunication (verbalism).IJSER © 2013h ttp://www.ijser.orgInternational Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research Volume 4, Issue 2, February-2013 9ISSN 2229-5518The use of Teaching Learning Materials besides the use of printed and spoken word may help the teacher of various subjects in such a situation by providing an additional or alternative media for effective communication with his students.7. Working as a good motivating forceChildren are quite active by nature and enjoy listening and observing the things and phenomena. Use of audio-visual aid material attracts them well to the classroom activities, satisfies the needs of their urges, instincts, basic and motivates and thus prove a potent motivating force to energize their learning behavior.8. Helpful in proving adequate impressions or imagesEvery experience gained at the time of learning leaves behind an image or impression in the minds of learners. The effectiveness of the learning depends upon the quality of this image or impression Teaching Learning Materials in Science provide such experiences that leave behind a permanent mark in the form of adequate impressions or image and thus aid to good retention and relatively permanent learning.9. Providing reinforcement to the learnersTeaching Learning Materials in Science prove effective reinforcing agent by increasing the probability of the reoccurrence of the responses associated with them. The experiences are so much connected and associated with the relevant used aids that the learner get sufficient reinforcement for keeping these experiences remembered for a long time.

For example, the children with learning difficulties may be helped through the use of various relevant visual aid material. Similarly those suffering from the visual difficulties may be helped through. The slow learners and mentally restarted may be given concrete experiences through use of some well illustrated, simple and meaningful aid material and gifted or genius may be elevated to a position of higher cognitive thinking and functioning by the use of appropriate teaching learning aids.11. Helpful in the development of mental facultiesLecturing and adoption of text book method in the class by the teacher can't help in the proper development of the intellectual faculties of the children. It can merely lead to role memorization on the part of the students without having any insight and understanding of the things and events. On the other hand the use.Teaching Learning Material is capable of providing such learning opportunities which may stir the imagination, thinking process and reasoning power of the students. It may also call for the originality, creativity, inventiveness and other higher mental activities on the part of the students and thus they help in the nourishment and development of the mental faculties of the students of elementary level.12.

Teaching Learning Materials, through its wide variety of stimuli, provision of active participation and adequate experiences prove helpful in the establishment of proper educational environment and healthy classroom interaction for the effective realization of the teaching learning objectives.13. Helpful in solving the problem of indisciplineThe problem of classroom indiscipline in many ways has its roots in the uncongenial and unhealthy classroom environment. In case the pupils are kept passive recipients of the knowledge and are bombarded through extreme verbalism, they are bound to get bored, fatigued or lose interest in learning. Many of these in such a situation may generate indiscipline in the classroom. With the Teaching Learning Materials, there is very little scope left for the creation of a passive dull and uninteresting environment in the classroom. Moreover it provides a variety creative channels for the students to utilize their tremendous energy which might be otherwise use for making mischief and creating indiscipline in the classroom.14. Helpful in developing inquiry habit and scientific attitudeUse of the Teaching Learning Materials in the process of teaching and learning may help the teachers of elementary level In developing inquiry habit and cultivating scientific attitude among his students. As a result they no longer remain a passive listener and do not believe merely in here saying but try to observe and experiments these facts through there own generalizations reached through the use of Teaching Learning Materials.15. Helpful in the satisfaction of individual differencesWide individual differences are found among the learners of primary level in terms of their abilities to learn and the methods of learning. Some are ear minded, some can learn easily throughIJSER © 2013h ttp://www.ijser.orgInternational Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research Volume 4, Issue 2, February-2013 12ISSN 2229-5518imitation, while other prefers self attempts and self doing. Consequently there arises a great need of meeting such varying requirements of the learner. Teaching Learning Material may help the teacher at elementary level in this situation by satisfying the requirement of the learner. Concerning individual differences among the different types of pupils.16. Providing opportunity for the use of progressive methods and techniquesAll the progressive methods and techniques used for teaching the various subjects discourage cramming and inactiveness on the part of the students of primary level. These are based on the psychological requirements of the learner and lay emphasis on the active participation of the students in the teaching learning process The use of Teaching Learning Materials is not only helpful in creating suitable environment for the introduction of the progressive methods and techniques but also helps in making the proper and effective use of these methods and techniques for realizing the relevant teaching learning objectives.17. Helpful in making Use of maximums of teachingMaxims of teaching like simple to complex, concrete to abstract known to unknown, learning by doing etc help in improving the process and products of the teaching learning process. The use of teaching learning materials facilities and improves the possibilities of making use of all such maxims by the teacher of elementary level in their teaching task.CLASSIFICATION OF INSTRUCTIONAL AIDS FOR TEACHING LEARNING MATERIALS IN SCIENCEInstructional Technology refers to the systematic use ofcategory of Instructional material.
