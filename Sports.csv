Sports;Sports documentaries explore the human experience through the riveting world of athleticsand whether youre a die-hard fan of a particular discipline or simply love a good story the best sports documentaries offer unforgettable insights and fascinating perspectives on the games we love.

So get ready to get your heart rate up and maybe even be inspired with Vogues round-up of some of the best sports documentaries ever made.Whether or not you consider yourself a sports fan you have to admit the industry has a hold on pop culture. Elite athletes like Michael Jordan and Serena Williams have been celebrities in their own right for decades and the ability to leverage their star status off of their respective playing fields to make them bona fide entrepreneurs has only made them more popular. And with social media the masses now get a sense of the inner lives athletes wish to share themselves not just the stories others wish to tell about their victories defeats and legacies.Those stories are high drama. Not just the kind we assume will happen on reality television these days but a genre that spans the expanse of human emotion from uproarious laughter to full-out sobs to seething anger. Sports is its own universe where societal norms about the presence of emotion or lack thereof are turned on their head. Youll often see not only top athletes but their fans and onlookers steeped resolutely in their feelings throughout an entire match whether its a court-pounding basketball game or the methodical strokes of golf.I was under the impression that I didnt care much about sports. But quickly after diving into documentaries around different kinds of athleticism I realized I really do enjoy them. Im just more of a sports history girlie than someone who could be captivated by watching a game from start to finish. You might be too so heres a list of some of the best docs out there that will help boost your sports knowledge while keeping you on the edge of your seat.Even if youve never owned a pair of Jordans you definitely know who Michael Jordan is. And though he hasnt played for quite some time his legacy is undeniable he went on to win six NBA championship rings with the Chicago Bulls in the early to late 90s. The crying meme that boasts his face shares just a smidge of the emotion he his teammates his rivals and other notable sports figures touch upon in this ten-episode series. Prepare to be entertained because the tea is being spilled here and its HOT. The Nancy Kerrigan versus Tonya Harding feud is undoubtedly one of sports most infamous disputes and this installment of ESPN: 30 for 30 documents how it all played out before Kerrigan was attacked. Though she doesnt give a one-on-one interview in the episode Harding does revealing just how much there was to learn about the talented athlete before 2017s fictional profile I Tonya sweept awards shows. This doc will take you right back to the 90s and your figure-skating obsession.
Sports;It was a superb Hollywood face-lift. By announcing a major overhaul in its controversial documentary nominating process the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences tried late last month to look good despite one of the most embarrassing and widely criticized episodes in its history the snubbing of Hoop Dreams last years highly praised film about two teenage basketball hopefuls struggling to make it out of inner-city Chicago and into the pros. I dont know that any of these changes would have made any difference at all in the outcome of nominations Academy president Arthur Hiller said in June. And indeed many of the changes he announced seemed benign. From now on branches in New York and Los Angeles will split the initial viewing of contenders for nominations and a strange seven-point scoring system will be changed toa strange five-point scoring system. But the alterations are in fact intended to make certain that what happened to Hoop Dreams never happens to another film and although nobody at the Academy is using the word Hillers own internal investigation appears to have revealed that Hoop Dreams omission was indeed something of a conspiracy. The outrage began on Valentines Day when it became clear that the perennially controversial documentary nominating committee had failed to put Dreams on the ballot. Some on the committee insisted the outcry was being drummed up to sell tickets by the films distributor Fine Line Features. Even without a nomination the film earned $7.8 million $ a strong showing for a nonfiction film. The Academys documentary committee had been losing public trust for well over a decade by disdaining most of the breakout nonfiction films critics adored the roster of documentaries that were never nominated includes Shoah 28 Up The Thin Blue Line Roger &amp Me Paris Is Burning Brothers Keeper and Truth or Dare. Each year committee members defended their choices by insisting theyd discovered five better films. But this year the critics went wild when Hoop Dreams and Terry Zwigoffs Crumb were denied nominations while among the final five was Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision whose director Freida Lee Mock had chaired the committee for the previous two years. Mocks film went on to take the award. I call it cronyism and this committee doesnt even understand what the word means said Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan last March. All of the committee members know and like Freida. Its human nature for them to have a tendency to vote for her. Theyre a cosa nostra. Before the reforms the committees elaborate yet primitive voting process had been to winnow down the entrants by shutting off the projector when more than half the viewing members deemed a film unworthy by shining flashlights. This year a galaxy of penlights in the dark of the Academys stuffy third-floor screening room nixed Crumb after 55 minutes. Though the film went on to win the Sundance documentary competition and some of the years best reviews one committee member who declined to be identified said Id been shining my light for a good while before that. Whats good for Sundance is not necessarily fit for us.
Sports;Sports physical contests pursued for the goals and challenges they entail. Sports are part of every culture past and present but each culture has its own definition of sports. The most useful definitions are those that clarify the relationship of sports to play games and contests. Play wrote the German theorist Carl Diem is purposeless activity for its own sake the opposite of work. Humans work because they have to they play because they want to. Play is autotelicthat is it has its own goals. It is voluntary and uncoerced. Recalcitrant children compelled by their parents or teachers to compete in a game of football soccer are not really engaged in a sport. Neither are professional athletes if their only motivation is their paycheck. In the real world as a practical matter motives are frequently mixed and often quite impossible to determine. Unambiguous definition is nonetheless a prerequisite to practical determinations about what is and is not an example of play.There are at least two types of play. The first is spontaneous and unconstrained. Examples abound. A child sees a flat stone picks it up and sends it skipping across the waters of a pond. An adult realizes with a laugh that he has uttered an unintended pun. Neither action is premeditated and both are at least relatively free of constraint. The second type of play is regulated. There are rules to determine which actions are legitimate and which are not. These rules transform spontaneous play into games which can thus be defined as rule-bound or regulated play. Leapfrog chess playing house and basketball are all games some with rather simple rules others governed by a somewhat more complex set of regulations. In fact the rule books for games such as basketball are hundreds of pages long.As games chess and basketball are obviously different from leapfrog and playing house. The first two games are competitive the second two are not. One can win a game of basketball but it makes no sense to ask who has won a game of leapfrog. In other words chess and basketball are contests.A final distinction separates contests into two types: those that require at least a minimum of physical skill and those that do not. Shuffleboard is a good example of the first the board games Scrabble and Monopoly will do to exemplify the second. It must of course be understood that even the simplest sports such as weightlifting require a modicum of intellectual effort while others such as baseball involve a considerable amount of mental alertness. It must also be understood that the sports that have most excited the passions of humankind as participants and as spectators have required a great deal more physical prowess than a game of shuffleboard. Through the ages sports heroes have demonstrated awesome strength speed stamina endurance and dexterity.levels of playSports then can be defined as autotelic played for their own sake physical contests. On the basis of this definition one can devise a simple inverted-tree diagram. Despite the clarity of the definition difficult questions arise. Is mountain climbing a sport? It is if one understands the activity as a contest between the climber and the mountain or as a competition between climbers to be the first to accomplish an ascent. Are the drivers at the Indianapolis 500 automobile race really athletes? They are if one believes that at least a modicum of physical skill is required for winning the competition. The point of a clear definition is that it enables one to give more or less satisfactory answers to questions such as these. One can hardly understand sport if one does not begin with some conception of what sports are.
Sports;No one can say when sports began. Since it is impossible to imagine a time when children did not spontaneously run races or wrestle it is clear that children have always included sports in their play but one can only speculate about the emergence of sports as autotelic physical contests for adults. Hunters are depicted in prehistoric art but it cannot be known whether the hunters pursued their prey in a mood of grim necessity or with the joyful abandon of sportsmen. It is certain however from the rich literary and iconographic evidence of all ancient civilizations that hunting soon became an end in itselfat least for royalty and nobility. Archaeological evidence also indicates that ball games were common among ancient peoples as different as the Chinese and the Aztecs. If ball games were contests rather than noncompetitive ritual performances such as the Japanese football game kemari then they were sports in the most rigorously defined sense. That it cannot simply be assumed that they were contests is clear from the evidence presented by Greek and Roman antiquity which indicates that ball games had been for the most part playful pastimes like those recommended for health by the Greek physician Galen in the 2nd century CE.It is unlikely that the 7th-century Islamic conquest of North Africa radically altered the traditional sports of the region. As long as wars were fought with bow and arrow archery contests continued to serve as demonstrations of ready prowess. The prophet Muhammad specifically authorized horse races and geography dictated that men race camels as well as horses. Hunters too took their pleasures on horseback.Among the many games of North Africa was ta kurt om el mahag the ball of the pilgrims mother a Berber bat-and-ball contest whose configuration bore an uncanny resemblance to baseball. Koura more widely played was similar to football soccer.Cultural variation among black Africans was far greater than among the Arab peoples of the northern littoral. Ball games were rare but wrestling of one kind or another was ubiquitous. Wrestlings forms and functions varied from tribe to tribe. For the Nuba of southern Sudan ritual bouts for which mens bodies were elaborately decorated as well as carefully trained were the primary source of male status and prestige. The Tutsi and Hutu of Rwanda were among the peoples who staged contests between females. Among the various peoples of sub-Saharan Africa wrestling matches were a way to celebrate or symbolically encourage human fertility and the earths fecundity. In southern Nigeria for instance Igbo tribesmen participated in wrestling matches held every eighth day throughout the three months of the rainy season hard-fought contests it was thought persuaded the gods to grant abundant harvests of corn maize and yams. Among the Diola of the Gambia adolescent boys and girls wrestled though not against one another in what was clearly a prenuptial ceremony. Male champions were married to their female counterparts. In other tribes such as the Yala of Nigeria the Fon of Benin and the Njabi of the Congo boys and girls grappled with each other. Among the Kole it was the kin of the bride and the bridegroom who wrestled. Stick fights which seem to have been less closely associated with religious practices were common among many tribes including the Zulu and Mpondo of southern Africa.Contests for runners and jumpers were to be found across the length and breadth of the continent. During the age of imperialism explorers and colonizers were often astonished by the prowess of these primitive peoples. Nandi runners of Kenyas Rift Valley seemed to run distances effortlessly at a pace that brought European runners to pitiable physical collapse. Tutsi high jumpers of Rwanda and Burundi soared to heights that might have seemed incredible had not the jumpers been photographed in flight by members of Adolf Friedrich zu Mecklenburgs anthropological expedition at the turn of the 20th century.
Sports;Like the highly evolved civilizations of which they are a part traditional Asian sports are ancient and various. Competitions were never as simple as they seemed to be. From the Islamic Middle East across the Indian subcontinent to China and Japan wrestlersmostly but not exclusively maleembodied and enacted the values of their cultures. The wrestlers strength was always more than a merely personal statement. More often than not the men who strained and struggled understood themselves to be involved in a religious endeavour. Prayers incantations and rituals of purification were for centuries an important aspect of the hand-to-hand combat of Islamic wrestlers. It was not unusual to combine the skills of the wrestler with those of a mystic poet. Indeed the celebrated 1th-century Persian pahlavan ritual wrestler Ma?m?d Khw?rezm? was both.Typical of the place of sport within a religious context was the spectacle of 50 sturdy Turks who wrestled in Istanbul in 1582 to celebrate the circumcision of the son of Murad III. When Indian wrestlers join an akhara gymnasium they commit themselves to the quest for a holy life. As devout Hindus they recite mantras as they do their knee bends and push-ups. In their struggle against pollution they strictly control their diet sexual habits breathing and even their urination and defecation.While the religious aspects of Turkish and Iranian houses of strength where weightlifting and gymnastics were practiced became much less salient in the course of the 20th century the elders in charge of Japanese sumo added a number of Shint? elements to the rituals of their sport to underscore their claim that it is a unique expression of Japanese tradition. A somewhat arbitrary distinction can be made between wrestling and the many forms of unarmed hand-to-hand combat categorized as martial arts. The emphasis of the latter is military rather than religious instrumental rather than expressive. Chinese wushu military skill which included armed as well as unarmed combat was highly developed by the 3rd century BCE. Its unarmed techniques were especially prized within Chinese culture and were an important influence on the martial arts of Korea Japan and Southeast Asia. Much less well known in the West are varma adi hitting the vital spots and other martial arts traditions of South Asia. In the early modern era as unarmed combat became obsolete the emphasis of Asian martial arts tended to shift back toward religion. This shift can often be seen in the language of sports. Japanese kenjutsu techniques of the sword became kend? the way of the sword.Of the armed as opposed to unarmed martial arts archery was among the most important in the lives of Asian warriors from the Arabian to the Korean peninsulas. Notably the Japanese samurai practiced many forms of archery the most colourful of which was probably yabusame whose mounted contestants drew their bows and loosed their arrows while galloping down a straight track some 720 to 885 feet 220 to 270 metres long. They were required to shoot in quick succession at three small targetseach about 9 square inches 55 square cm placed on 3-foot- 0.9-metre- high poles 23 to 36 feet 7 to 11 metres from the track and spaced at intervals of 235 to 295 feet 71.5 to 90 metres. In yabusame accuracy was paramount.In Turkey where the composite wood plus horn bow was an instrument of great power archers competed for distance. At Istanbuls Okmeydan? Arrow Field the record was set in 1798 when Selim IIIs arrow flew more than 2 900 feet 88 metres.
Sports;As can be seen in Mughal art of the 16th and 17th centuries aristocratic Indianslike their counterparts throughout Asiaused their bows and arrows for hunting as well as for archery contests. Mounted hunters demonstrated equestrian as well as toxophilite skills. The Asian aristocrats passion for horses which can be traced as far back as Hittite times if not earlier led not only to horse races universal throughout Asia but also to the development of polo and a host of similar equestrian contests. These equestrian games may in fact be the most distinctive Asian contribution to the repertory of modern sports.In all probability polo evolved from a far rougher game played by the nomads of Afghanistan and Central Asia. In the form that survived into the 21st century Afghan buzkashi is characterized by a dusty melee in which hundreds of mounted tribesmen fought over the headless carcass of a goat. The winner was the hardy rider who managed to grab the animal by the leg and drag it clear of the pack. Since buzkashi was clearly an inappropriate passion for a civilized monarch polo filled the bill. Persian manuscripts from the 6th century refer to polo played during the reign of Hormuz I 271273. The game was painted by miniaturists and celebrated by Persian poets such as Ferdows? c. 935c. 1020 and ??fe? 1325/261389/90. By 627 polo had spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and had reached China where it became a passion among those wealthy enough to own horses. All 16 emperors of the Tang dynasty 618907 were polo players. As with most sports the vast majority of polo players were male but the 12th-century Persian poet Ne??m? commemorated the skills of Princess Sh?r?n. Moreover if numerous terra-cotta figures can be trusted as evidence polo was also played by aristocratic Chinese women.There were also ball games for ordinary men and women. Played with carefully sewn stuffed skins with animal bladders or with found objects as simple as gourds chunks of wood or rounded stones ball games are universal. Ball games of all sorts were quite popular among the Chinese. Descriptions of the game cuju which resembled modern football soccer appeared as early as the Eastern Han dynasty 25220. Games similar to modern badminton were also played in the 1st century. Finally the Ming dynasty 136816 scroll painting Grove of Violets depicts elegantly attired ladies playing chuiwan a game similar to modern golf.Sports were unquestionably common in ancient Egypt where pharaohs used their hunting prowess and exhibitions of strength and skill in archery to demonstrate their fitness to rule. In such exhibitions pharaohs such as Amenhotep II ruled 126100 BCE never competed against anyone else however and there is reason to suspect that their extraordinary achievements were scribal fictions. Nonetheless Egyptians with less claim to divinity wrestled jumped and engaged in ball games and stick fights. In paintings found at Beni Hassan in a tomb dating from the Middle Kingdom 1938c. 1630 BCE there are studies of 06 pairs of wrestlers demonstrating their skill.
Sports;Since Minoan script still baffles scholars it is uncertain whether images of Cretan boys and girls testing their acrobatic skills against bulls depict sport religious ritual or both. That the feats of the Cretans may have been both sport and ritual is suggested by evidence from Greece where sports had a cultural significance unequaled anywhere else before the rise of modern sports. Secular and religious motives mingle in historys first extensive sports report found in Book XXIII of Homers Iliad in the form of funeral games for the dead Patroclus. These games were part of Greek religion and were not therefore autotelic the contests in the Odyssey on the other hand were essentially secular. Odysseus was challenged by the Phaeacians to demonstrate his prowess as an athlete. In general Greek culture included both cultic sports such as the Olympic Games honouring Zeus and secular contests.The most famous association of sports and religion was certainly the Olympic Games which Greek tradition dates from 776 BCE. In the course of time the earth goddess Gaea originally worshiped at Olympia was supplanted in importance by the sky god Zeus in whose honour priestly officials conducted quadrennial athletic contests. Sacred games also were held at Delphi in honour of Apollo Corinth and Nemea. These four events were known as the periodos and great athletes such as Theagenes of Thasos prided themselves on victories at all four sites. Although most of the events contested at Greek sacred games remain familiar the most important competition was the chariot race. The extraordinary prestige accorded athletic triumphs brought with it not only literary accolades as in the odes of Pindar and visual commemoration in the form of statues of the victors but also material benefits contrary to the amateur myth propagated by 19th-century philhellenists. Since the Greeks were devoted to secular sports as well as to sacred games no polis or city-state was considered a proper community if it lacked a gymnasium where as the word gymnos indicates naked male athletes trained and competed. Except in militaristic Sparta Greek women rarely participated in sports of any kind. They were excluded from the Olympic Games even as spectators except for the priestess of Demeter. The 2nd-century-CE traveler Pausanias wrote of races for girls at Olympia but these events in honour of Hera were of minor importance. Rome Although chariot races were among the most popular sports spectacles of the Roman and Byzantine eras as they had been in Greek times the Romans of the republic and the early empire were quite selectively enthusiastic about Greek athletic contests. Emphasizing physical exercises for military preparedness an important motive in all ancient civilizations the Romans preferred boxing wrestling and hurling the javelin to running footraces and throwing the discus. The historian Livy wrote of Greek athletes appearing in Rome as early as 186 BCE however the contestants nudity shocked Roman moralists. The emperor Augustus instituted the Actian Games in 27 BCE to celebrate his victory over Antony and Cleopatra and several of his successors began similar games but it was not until the later empire especially during the reign of Hadrian 117138 CE that many of the Roman elite developed an enthusiasm for Greek athletics.Greater numbers flocked to the chariot races held in Romes Circus Maximus. They were watched by as many as 250 000 spectators five times the number that crowded into the Colosseum to enjoy gladiatorial combat. Nevertheless there is some evidence that the latter contests were actually more popular than the former. Indeed the munera which pitted man against man and the venationes which set men against animals became popular even in the Greek-speaking Eastern Empire which historians once thought immune from the lust for blood. The greater frequency of chariot races can be explained in part by the fact that they were relatively inexpensive compared with the enormous costs of gladiatorial combat. The editor who staged the games usually rented the gladiators from a lanista the manager of a troupe of gladiators and was required to reimburse him for losers executed in response to a thumbs down sign. Brutal as these combats were many of the gladiators were free men who volunteered to fight an obvious sign of intrinsic motivation. Indeed imperial edicts were needed to discourage the aristocracys participation. During the reign of Nero 568 female gladiators were introduced into the arena.
Sports;Cricket is the most popular sport in Pakistan. Almost all districts and neighbourhoods in Pakistan have a cricket team and people start playing from a young age. Pakistan has won international cricket events which include the 1992 Cricket World Cup the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy besides finishing as runner-up in the 1999 Cricket World Cup 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2022 T20 World Cup. Pakistan also won the ACC Asia Cup in 2000 and 2012 and all three versions of the Austral-Asia Cup.Pakistan's cricket teams take part in domestic competitions such as the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy the Patron's Trophy ABN-AMRO Twenty-20 Cup and the ABN-AMRO Champions Trophy. Pakistan Cricket Board also organize a franchise based T20 cricket league known as the Pakistan Super League.International Test and one-day matches are played between the Pakistan national cricket team and foreign opponents regularly. Women's cricket is also very popular with Kiran Baluch holding the current record for the highest score in a women's test match with her innings of 22. The Pakistan Cricket Board controls both the men's and women's games. The 2020 Pakistan Super League events was hosted entirely by Pakistan. Notable cricketers from Pakistan include Aaqib Javed Ramiz Raja Babar Azam Shoaib Akhtar Younis Khan Saqlain Mushtaq Mushtaq Ahmed Abdul Qadir Wasim Akram Zaheer Abbas Javed Miandad Saeed Anwar Muhammad Yousaf Inzamam-ul-Haq Waqar Younis Shahid Afridi the Mohammad brothers Hanif Mushtaq Sadiq and Wazir and Imran Khan. Imran Khan has been named in the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Saeed Anwar's 19 runs against India remained the record for most runs by a batsman in an ODI for 11 years which was broken by Fakhar Zaman's 210 against Zimbabwe in 2018. Shoaib Akhtar holds the record of delivering the fastest delivery in the history of cricket. Shahid Afridi holds numerous records i.e. the 3rd fastest century in ODIs and the highest number of sixes in international cricket. Wasim Akram at the time of his retirement had taken the most wickets in ODIs. Muhammad Yousuf has scored the most Test runs in a calendar year. The structure of domestic cricket in Pakistan at the highest level has changed many times since 197 with the latest restructure being enforced in 2019.16 Previously domestic cricket operated with departmental city and regional teams - a set up encouraged by Abdul Hafeez Kardar.17 Since 197 the domestic first class cricket system has varied considerably per year with teams ranging from 7 to 26 and tournament matches operating under different formats often changes occurred every year. With the advent of domestic List A and T20 forms of cricket in the 1970s and 2000s there has been no consistent set up as has been noted for first class cricket in Pakistan. Historically school and club cricket has also suffered due to inconsistencies in top tier domestic cricket. The consistent changes in the domestic structure and the gradual introduction of departmental teams was encouraged as it provided permanent jobs to players. Matches were rarely televised due to lack of quality cricket and lack of interest in departmental cricket.

Sports;Pakistan is known as the manufacturer of the official FIFA World Cup ball. The Pakistan Football Federation PFF is the governing body in Pakistan.The origin of football in Pakistan can be traced back to the mid-nineteenth century when the game was introduced during the British Raj. Initially games were played between army teams. However clubs were soon set up around the country.2 One of the regional federations to organize football on what is now Pakistan Territory was the North-West India Football Association in which clubs from the city of Lahore and the surrounding region were active.3 Kohat FC was the first club to be established in 1930 it became the first outstation team to win the North-West India Football Championship 1937 in 1937 defeating Government College Lahore 10 in the finals.3 The first female club to be established was Diya W.F.C. in 2002.Shortly after the creation of Pakistan in 197 the Pakistan Football Federation PFF was created and Muhammad Ali Jinnah became its first Patron-in-Chief. PFF received recognition from FIFA in early 198.5 The annual National Championship was organized shortly after. In 1950 the national team gained their first international experience in Iran and Iraq.The Pakistan Football Federation Women Organizing Committee PFFWOC is responsible for women's football in Pakistan.

A women's team was formed in 2017. A major national tournament was organized in 2018.8 Australia sent a coach to assist Pakistan in 2019 however the sport's rapid growth in popularity was greatly outpacing local officials ability to support it.9 10 of Pakistan's more than 15 clubs contested the 2021 AFL Pakistan National Championships in Islamabad. Pakistan sent a team to the Asian Championship in 2022 however met some roadblocks to participation due to funding.51 Despite challenges sending a team it won the Division 3 title.52 In 2022 AFL Asia reported that Pakistan was the largest and fastest growing nation for the sport in Asia with over 5 000 players with a 5% annual increase in participation.53 The Pakistan national side are known as the Dragoons.Upon Pakistan's independence in 197 both East and West wings of the country inherited the football infrastructure of the British Raj.3 The need for establishing a nationwide football association to govern the game properly was urgent since India had inherited the erstwhile Calcutta-based Indian Football Association and the All-India Football Federation AIFF.

That the feats of the Cretans may have been both sport and ritual is suggested by evidence from Greece where sports had a cultural significance unequaled anywhere else before the rise of modern sports. Secular and religious motives mingle in historys first extensive sports report found in Book XXIII of Homers Iliad in the form of funeral games for the dead Patroclus. These games were part of Greek religion and were not therefore autotelic the contests in the Odyssey on the other hand were essentially secular. Odysseus was challenged by the Phaeacians to demonstrate his prowess as an athlete. In general Greek culture included both cultic sports such as the Olympic Games honouring Zeus and secular contests.

As games chess and basketball are obviously different from leapfrog and playing house. The first two games are competitive the second two are not. One can win a game of basketball but it makes no sense to ask who has won a game of leapfrog. In other words chess and basketball are contests.

Chittagong was made up from European players while the Rifles were all Pakistani apart from their coach J.M. Reay.3 The sixties saw a decrease in the expatriate population and travel to India becoming more regulated therefore the club became more reliant on playing fixtures with visiting British Navy Ships at a time when Karachi had become a regular port of call for R&R and supplies.2 In 19681969 a handful of local players were introduced into the club: this would prove to be the saving grace for the game in the country. By the mid seventies the British Navy reduced its presence in the Indian Ocean and port visits became infrequent and by the early eighties Rugby had become almost non-existent. The Karachi Rugby Football Union continued to play yet due to limited funds it was unable to travel abroad for matches and suffered from lack of opposing teams to play within the country.
