Health & Fitness;Why is exercise so important for seniors? Whether you were once much more physically active or have never been one to exercise regularly  now is a great time to start an exercise and fitness regimen. Getting and staying in shape is just as important for seniors as it is for younger people. Why is exercise important for older people? Getting your heart rate up and challenging your muscles benefits virtually every system in your body and improves your physical and mental health in myriad ways. Physical activity helps maintain a healthy blood pressure  keeps harmful plaque from building up in your arteries  reduces inflammation  improves blood sugar levels  strengthens bones  and helps stave off depression. In addition  a regular exercise program can make your sex life better  lead to better quality sleep  reduce your risk of some cancers  and is linked to longer life. Many older adults hesitate to get moving because theyre unfamiliar with the types of exercise and fitness that are effective and safe  and arent sure how much exercise they need to do. The good news is that any kind of movement is better than being sedentary  so theres nothing wrong with starting small and working your way up to longer workouts. Your goal should be no less than 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week  but if you cant start at that level  work up to it (and then past it). While there are many dedicated forms of exercise and fitness for adults  you also want to stay physically active throughout the day by taking the stairs  doing yard work  and playing with your grandkids. When it comes to exercise and fitness for seniors  most can begin without consulting a doctor�but there are exceptions. If you have a major health condition like diabetes  high blood pressure  heart or lung disease  osteoprosis or a neurological disease  definitely talk to your doctor first. People with mobility issues such as poor balance or arthritis should also get advice from their doctor. What are the best types of exercise? While there are endless forms of exercise  experts categorize physical activity into four broad types based on what each calls upon your body to do and how the movement benefits you. Aerobic exercise is marked by an increased heart rate. Although most aerobic exercises require you to move your whole body  the main focus is on your heart and lungs (Aerobic exercise is often called �cardio� because it challenges and benefits your cardiovascular system). Activities like walking  swimming  dancing and cycling  if done at sufficient intensity  get you breathing faster and your heart working harder. Aerobic exercises burn fat  improve your mood  reduce inflammation and lower blood sugar. Strength training  sometimes called resistance training  should be performed two to three times a week. Squats  lunges  push  ups and the exercises performed on resistance machines or using weights or bands help maintain and even build muscle mass and strength. Strength training also helps prevent falls  keep bones strong  lower blood sugar levels  and improve balance. Do a combination of both isometric and isotonic exercises. Isometric exercises  such as doing planks and holding leg lifts  are done without movement. They are great for maintaining strength and improving stability. Isotonic exercises require you to bear weight throughout a range of motion. Bicep curls  bench presses and sit  ups are all forms of isotonic exercise. Stretching exercises keep your muscles and tendons flexible  preserve your posture  and improve mobility  especially as you age. Stretching can be done every day. Balance exercises call on the various systems that help you stay upright and oriented  such as those of the inner ear  vision and muscles and joints. Tai chi and yoga are great forms of balance exercises that can help you avoid falls and stay independent well into your senior years.;
Health & Fitness;What if my exercise ability is limited? Everyone can and should do some form of exercise  even if they face severe limitations. Experts have designed specific exercises for seniors that are low  impact  safe and able to be done even from a sitting position if necessary. If youre concerned about fall risk  balance exercises for seniors can be done holding onto a chair or doorframe. For example  standing behind a chair  you can hold its back and lift one leg to about the height of the middle of the calf of the other leg while tightening your abdominal muscles. As you progress  you might try holding the chair with just one hand and eventually letting go of the chair. Even core  strengthening exercises for seniors can be adapted to those with limited abilities. For example  a standard plank is done by holding yourself parallel to the floor with only your forearms and toes touching the mat. An easier version allows you to also place your knees on the mat. But a still easier method is to do the plank while standing and leaning forward. You put your elbows and forearms on a desk  table or wall while resting on the balls of your feet and keeping your back straight. There are a variety of stretching exercises for seniors to suit people of different abilities. If holding poses on your hands and knees is out of the question  you could try a full  body stretch in which you lie on your back  straighten your legs and extend your hands along the floor past your head. Some stretches can be done while seated  such as overhead stretches and neck rotations. In fact  other types of exercise also can be done from a seated position. Other chair exercises for seniors include bicep curls (with dumbbells or elastic bands)  overhead dumbbell presses  shoulder blade squeezes  calf raises  sit  to  stands (chair squats) and knee extensions. What exercises are best for heart health? The best exercise program will incorporate both aerobic and strength training  since thats the best way to strengthen your entire body  improve your endurance and ensure your long  term health. But if your main concern is how to improve cardiovascular health  then you should put a premium on cardiovascular exercises that force your heart and lungs to work harder  sending oxygen to your cells. While strength training certainly does have cardiovascular benefits  cardio workouts excel when it comes to reducing blood pressure  maintaining the health of the inner walls of your arteries  releasing enzymes that break down blood clots  and even promoting the growth of new arteries feeding the heart. Regular aerobic exercise also significantly lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes. Although diabetes usually isnt thought of as a heart problem  a lower risk of diabetes also lowers the risk of heart disease  since high blood sugar takes a toll on blood vessels and the nerves that control the heart. When you exercise  you call on your bodys cells to take glucose (sugar) out of the blood  which they do by becoming more sensitive to insulin  the hormone crucial to glucose metabolism. That means your cells remain insulin  sensitive long after youre finished exercising. And since obesity is a significant risk for diabetes  exercises that help you shed fat�especially around your middle�will help you keep diabetes at bay.;
Health & Fitness;How much exercise do I need? How much exercise you should be getting depends on several factors  including your current level of fitness  your fitness goals  the types of exercise youre planning to do  and whether you have deficits in such areas as strength  flexibility or balance. As a general rule  150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity (or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise) is recommended as a weekly minimum. As you become more fit  youll want to exceed that in order to reap maximum benefit. A natural way of splitting up the 150 minutes might be to do a 30  minute session five times per week  or you can break it up and do two 15  minute sessions during a single day. Adopt whatever schedule fits your lifestyle.For strength exercises  aim to work all your major muscle groups twice to three times each week  leaving 48 hours between each workout for recovery. If you do �total  body� workouts  thats two sessions per week. If you choose to split your workouts to target a specific muscle group (e.g.  �leg day�)  that will require more frequent workouts. Just make sure youre leaving 48 hours of rest before you re  work a major muscle. If you have noticed problems with your balance  such as unsteadiness  dizziness  or vertigo  talk to a healthcare provider for recommendations about balance  specific exercises. Get in three half  hour workouts each week in addition to a 30  minute walk at least twice weekly.Its best to stretch after you have warmed up for a few minutes  or perform  stretching exercises after you completed your workout. When stretching each muscle group  take it slow and steady  release  repeat again. But how much exercise is too much? You should expect a little muscle soreness after workouts  especially in the beginning. But if you find that your body is simply not recovering between workouts  you may be overtraining. Remember that seniors need more recovery time than younger people. With the exception of �welcome� muscle soreness  an exercise program should make you feel good. If it doesnt  youre probably overdoing it. That doesnt mean you should quit  only that you should dial back the intensity or frequency of your workouts until you hit the �sweet spot� in which youve �tired out� your body but then recovered enough to tackle your next session with enthusiasm.What are the benefits of exercise?A smartly designed exercise program will benefit your body and mind in innumerable ways.The benefits of exercise on mental health are well documented. For example  one major study found that sedentary people are 44% more likely to be depressed. Another found that those with mild to moderate depression could get similar results to those obtained through antidepressants just by exercising for 90 minutes each week. The key appears to be the release of brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine  which help lift mood and combat stress.Were all familiar with exercises ability to improve cardiovascular health. But how does exercise lower blood pressure? Interestingly  when you stimulate your circulatory system through aerobic exercise  youre temporarily increasing your blood pressure by forcing the system to work harder�but when youve finished exercising  your blood pressure drops to a lower level than it was before you began.Many people think of exercise as an integral part of weight loss�and  although diet is also extremely important  theyre not wrong. But what exercise burns the most calories? Generally  aerobic exercises (cardio) are great for expending calories and reducing fat. But dont overlook the effectiveness of strength training  which optimizes your bodys ratio of lean muscle to fat (Its also the best exercise for bone strength). Theres no Holy Grail when it comes to a single best weight  loss exercise. The best exercise to lose weight is the one youll do consistently. Whatever gets your heart rate up and gets your body moving�while having fun and staying motivated�is the exercise that will help you shed pounds.;
Health & Fitness;What are the mental health benefits of exercise?Exercise is not just about aerobic capacity and muscle size. Sure  exercise can improve your physical health and your physique  trim your waistline  improve your sex life  and even add years to your life. But thats not what motivates most people to stay active.People who exercise regularly tend to do so because it gives them an enormous sense of well  being. They feel more energetic throughout the day  sleep better at night  have sharper memories  and feel more relaxed and positive about themselves and their lives. And its also a powerful medicine for many common mental health challenges.Regular exercise can have a profoundly positive impact on depression  anxiety  and ADHD. It also relieves stress  improves memory  helps you sleep better  and boosts your overall mood. And you dont have to be a fitness fanatic to reap the benefits. Research indicates that modest amounts of exercise can make a real difference. No matter your age or fitness level  you can learn to use exercise as a powerful tool to deal with mental health problems  improve your energy and outlook  and get more out of life.Exercise and depression.Studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medication�but without the side  effects  of course. As one example  a recent study done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that running for 15 minutes a day or walking for an hour reduces the risk of major depression by 26%. In addition to relieving depression symptoms  research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing.Exercise is a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly  it promotes all kinds of changes in the brain  including neural growth  reduced inflammation  and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well  being. It also releases endorphins  powerful chemicals in your brain that energize your spirits and make you feel good. Finally  exercise can also serve as a distraction  allowing you to find some quiet time to break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression.Exercise and anxiety Exercise is a natural and effective anti  anxiety treatment. It relieves tension and stress  boosts physical and mental energy  and enhances well  being through the release of endorphins. Anything that gets you moving can help  but youll get a bigger benefit if you pay attention instead of zoning out.Try to notice the sensation of your feet hitting the ground  for example  or the rhythm of your breathing  or the feeling of the wind on your skin. By adding this mindfulness  element�really focusing on your body and how it feels as you exercise�youll not only improve your physical condition faster  but you may also be able to interrupt the flow of constant worries running through your head.Exercise and stress. Ever noticed how your body feels when youre under stress? Your muscles may be tense  especially in your face  neck  and shoulders  leaving you with back or neck pain  or painful headaches. You may feel a tightness in your chest  a pounding pulse  or muscle cramps. You may also experience problems such as insomnia  heartburn  stomachache  diarrhea  or frequent urination. The worry and discomfort of all these physical symptoms can in turn lead to even more stress  creating a vicious cycle between your mind and body.;
Health & Fitness;Exercising is an effective way to break this cycle. As well as releasing endorphins in the brain  physical activity helps to relax the muscles and relieve tension in the body. Since the body and mind are so closely linked  when your body feels better so  too  will your mind.Exercise and ADHD Exercising regularly is one of the easiest and most effective ways to reduce the symptoms of ADHD and improve concentration  motivation  memory  and mood. Physical activity immediately boosts the brains dopamine  norepinephrine  and serotonin levels�all of which affect focus and attention. In this way  exercise works in much the same way as ADHD medications such as Ritalin and Adderall. Exercise and PTSD and trauma Evidence suggests that by really focusing on your body and how it feels as you exercise  you can actually help your nervous system become �unstuck� and begin to move out of the immobilization stress response that characterizes PTSD or trauma. Instead of allowing your mind to wander  pay close attention to the physical sensations in your joints and muscles  even your insides as your body moves. Exercises that involve cross movement and that engage both arms and legs�such as walking (especially in sand)  running  swimming  weight training  or dancing�are some of your best choices. Outdoor activities like hiking  sailing  mountain biking  rock climbing  whitewater rafting  and skiing (downhill and cross  country) have also been shown to reduce the symptoms of PTSD.

Health & Fitness;Reaping the mental health benefits of exercise is easier than you think You dont need to devote hours out of your busy day to train at the gym  sweat buckets  or run mile after monotonous mile to reap all the physical and mental health benefits of exercise. Just 30  minutes of moderate exercise five times a week is enough. And even that can be broken down into two 15  minute or even three 10  minute exercise sessions if thats easier.Even a little bit of activity is better than nothing If you dont have time for 15 or 30 minutes of exercise  or if your body tells you to take a break after 5 or 10 minutes  for example  thats okay  too. Start with 5   or 10  minute sessions and slowly increase your time. The more you exercise  the more energy youll have  so eventually youll feel ready for a little more. The key is to commit to some moderate physical activity�however little�on most days. As exercising becomes a habit  you can slowly add extra minutes or try different types of activities. If you keep at it  the benefits of exercise will begin to pay off.You dont have to suffer to get results Research shows that moderate levels of exercise are best for most people. Moderate means   That you breathe a little heavier than normal  but are not out of breath. For example  you should be able to chat with your walking partner  but not easily sing a song. That your body feels warmer as you move  but not overheated or very sweaty. Cant find time to exercise during the week? Be a weekend warrior A recent study in the United Kingdom found that people who squeeze their exercise routines into one or two sessions during the weekend experience almost as many health benefits as those who work out more often. So dont let a busy schedule at work  home  or school be an excuse to avoid activity. Get moving whenever you can find the time�your mind and body will thank you! Overcoming obstacles to exercise Even when you know that exercise will help you feel better  taking that first step is still easier said than done. Obstacles to exercising are very real�particularly when youre also struggling with a mental health issue. Here are some common barriers and how you can get past them. Feeling exhausted. When youre tired  depressed  or stressed  it seems that working out will just make you feel worse. But the truth is that physical activity is a powerful energizer. Studies show that regular exercise can dramatically reduce fatigue and increase your energy levels. If you are really feeling tired  promise yourself a quick  5  minute walk. Chances are  once you get moving youll have more energy and be able to walk for longer.Feeling overwhelmed. When youre stressed or depressed  the thought of adding another obligation to your busy daily schedule can seem overwhelming. Working out just doesnt seem practical. If you have children  finding childcare while you exercise can also be a big hurdle. However  if you begin thinking of physical activity as a priority (a necessity for your mental well  being)  youll soon find ways to fit small amounts of exercise into even the busiest schedule.;
Health & Fitness;Feeling hopeless. Even if youve never exercised before  you can still find ways to comfortably get active. Start slow with easy  low  impact activities a few minutes each day  such as walking or dancing. Feeling bad about yourself. Are you your own worst critic? Its time to try a new way of thinking about your body. No matter your weight  age or fitness level  there are plenty of others in the same boat. Ask a friend to exercise with you. Accomplishing even the smallest fitness goals will help you gain body confidence and improve how you think about yourself. Feeling pain. If you have a disability  severe weight problem  arthritis  or any injury or illness that limits your mobility  talk to your doctor about ways to safely exercise. You shouldnt ignore pain  but rather do what you can  when you can. Divide your exercise into shorter  more frequent chunks of time if that helps  or try exercising in water to reduce joint or muscle discomfort. Getting started with exercise when you have a mental health issue Many of us find it hard enough to motivate ourselves to exercise at the best of times. But when you feel depressed  anxious  stressed or have another mental health problem  it can seem doubly difficult. This is especially true of depression and anxiety  which can leave you feeling trapped in a catch  22 situation. You know exercise will make you feel better  but depression has robbed you of the energyand motivation you need to work out  or your social anxiety means you cant bear the thought of being seen at an exercise class or running through the park. Start small. When youre under the cloud of anxiety or depression and havent exercised for a long time  setting extravagant goals like completing a marathon or working out for an hour every morning will only leave you more despondent if you fall short. Better to set achievable goals and build up from there.Schedule workouts when your energy is highest. Perhaps you have most energy first thing in the morning before work or school or at lunchtime before the mid  afternoon lull hits? Or maybe you do better exercising for longer at the weekends. If depression or anxiety has you feeling tired and unmotivated all day long  try dancing to some music or simply going for a walk. Even a short  15  minute walk can help clear your mind  improve your mood  and boost your energy level. As you move and start to feel a little better  youll often boost your energy enough to exercise more vigorously�by walking further  breaking into a run  or adding a bike ride  for example.Focus on activities you enjoy. Any activity that gets you moving counts. That could include throwing a Frisbee with a dog or friend  walking laps of a mall window shopping  or cycling to the grocery store. If youve never exercised before or dont know what you might enjoy  try a few different things. Activities such as gardening or tackling a home improvement project can be great ways to start moving more when you have a mood disorder�as well as helping you become more active  they can also leave you with a sense of purpose and accomplishment.;
Health & Fitness;Be comfortable. Wear clothing thats comfortable and choose a setting that you find calming or energizing. That may be a quiet corner of your home  a scenic path  or your favorite city park.Reward yourself. Part of the reward of completing an activity is how much better youll feel afterwards  but it always helps your motivation to promise yourself an extra treat for exercising. Reward yourself with a hot bubble bath after a workout  a delicious smoothie  or with an extra episode of your favorite TV show  for example.Make exercise a social activity. Exercising with a friend or loved one  or even your kids  will not only make exercising more fun and enjoyable  it can also help motivate you to stick to a workout routine. Youll also feel better than if you were exercising alone. In fact  when youre suffering from a mood disorder such as depression  the companionship can be just as important as the exercise.Easy ways to move more that dont involve the gym Dont have a 30  minute block of time to dedicate to yoga or a bike ride? Dont worry. Think about physical activity as a lifestyle rather than just a single task to check off your to  do list. Look at your daily routine and consider ways to sneak in activity here  there  and everywhere. Move in and around your home. Clean the house  wash the car  tend to the yard and garden  mow the lawn with a push mower  sweep the sidewalk or patio with a broom. Sneak activity in at work or on the go. Bike or walk to an appointment rather than drive  use stairs instead of elevators  briskly walk to the bus stop then get off one stop early  park at the back of the lot and walk into the store or office  or take a vigorous walk during your coffee break. Get active with the family. Jog around the soccer field during your kids practice  make a neighborhood bike ride part of your weekend routine  play tag with your children in the yard  go canoeing at a lake  walk the dog in a new place. Get creative with exercise ideas. Pick fruit at an orchard  boogie to music  go to the beach or take a hike  gently stretch while watching television  organize an office bowling team  take a class in martial arts  dance  or yoga. Make exercise a fun part of your everyday life You dont have to spend hours in a gym or force yourself into long  monotonous workouts to experience the many benefits of exercise. These tips can help you find activities you enjoy and start to feel better  look better  and get more out of life. Studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medication�but without the side  effects  of course. As one example  a recent study done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that running for 15 minutes a day or walking for an hour reduces the risk of major depression by 26%. In addition to relieving depression symptoms  research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing;
Health & Fitness;High  intensity fitness programs are designed to burn fat and build muscle fast by stressing muscles more than other workouts. These programs can include high  intensity interval training or HIIT classes  such as Tabata. However  if they arent done properly  these workouts can lead to muscle and joint injuries.Before you think about starting high  intensity exercise  be sure youre able to do it safely. Our sports medicine team has some guidance and effective alternatives.What is an example of a high  intensity workout? High  intensity interval training  better known as HIIT  consists of short bursts of intense work that typically last between 15 seconds to 4 minutes. These are followed by a quick recovery period and then right back to the tough work. These cycles are repeated several times and can include a variety of exercises in each round. HIIT workouts can include the use of a stationary bike  treadmill  bodyweight  kettlebell  dumbbells  or jump rope. Another type of HIIT workout you may have heard of is called Tabata.What are the benefits of HIIT or other high  intensity exercises? HIIT and other high  intensity exercise programs help you burn a lot of calories in a short amount of time. Research has also showed that you keep burning calories for hours after your workout is finished. These workouts typically cause you to burn more fat and build muscle. Studies have also showed that high  intensity workouts may help lower blood pressure and heart rate.Can high  intensity exercise really be dangerous? The short answer is yes. However  the biggest danger to health is an inactive lifestyle  which is much more widespread than overdoing exercise. The goal should be to slowly overload the body for higher levels of performance  rather than to suddenly increase activity levels. While high  intensity exercise can lead to overuse injuries or muscle and joint injuries  these are less likely to occur with the right preparation.Are there any fitness trends that concern you? Any of the all  out group workouts that emphasize intensity instead of proper form and preparation can be a problem. These include programs that push you to do more sets and repetitions with heavier weights than youre comfortable with. Exercise should make you feel some burn in your muscles  but it should never be painful. Our UC Davis Health sports medicine physicians treat a lot of injuries related to these types of programs. Intensity can be great when done correctly. Too much  too soon is likely to cause problems.Why is it a problem for an inactive or casual fitness person to do intense fitness activities? The biggest issue is that moving regularly isnt something most people do. This can leave people who try to get in shape quickly more prone to injury.Inactive people who arent experienced with exercise or those who havent regularly exercised in a while tend to push themselves too much. In these situations  people often arent aware of how hard they can and should work. This is especially true for those who are doing a group workout. Can high  intensity exercise improve fitness? There are ways to mix in intensity and speed fitness  but that should not be the emphasis for most people. Start by moving more than you normally do throughout each day. This is more beneficial than a one tough workout every so often. At the same time  people who have been doing the same exercises for months are unlikely to get more fit unless they make changes. This could include changing their routines  pushing harder  and working beyond their comfort zones. What are some signs that youve gone too far with a workout? Pain is a big sign that a workout is causing trouble. If any exercise causes pain  dont push through it. Its a good idea to start slowly increasing physical activity and intensity. This will allow you to learn the difference between pain and being uncomfortable.;
Health & Fitness;Athletes have an ever  expanding variety of pills  powders  drinks  and other tools to choose from that promise to make them faster  stronger and bigger.Sales figures indicate that many athletes and fitness gurus have bought into that promise. But it  s largely an empty one. Performance supplements should not be a substitute for healthy nutrition and drinking water.Research on exercise supplements There  s no scientific evidence to support products that claim they  ll increase muscle size  strength  energy or athletic performance. But many athletes look for any way to gain an edge on their competition or quickly reach their personal goals.People are often swayed by clever marketing techniques  videos on social media  or professional athletes who endorse nutritional supplements. Often    experts   who aren  t qualified or don  t have a background in nutrition make inaccurate claims about these products.Because there is no standard for many of these supplements  it can be common to find several different chemical formulas  depending on the company. Each one claims it contains the same vital compound.Safety information on protein supplements Supplements for amino acids  the building blocks for protein  are promoted as helping build muscle. However  the average American diet already has two  to  three times more protein than is needed. It  s also important to note that high levels of specific amino acids can potentially produce a toxic effect. It can place an extra burden on your kidneys and contribute to kidney failure in the long  term. Unnecessarily adding individual vitamins and minerals into your diet can also create imbalances within your body. This can lead to major changes or long  term health effects. Unnecessary supplements can be potentially toxic and may reduce your body  s ability to absorb other nutrients.One example comes from a 2022 report released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The report included information that some bodybuilding products posed serious health risks. The FDA found that some products that claimed to help build muscle mass and strength illegally contained steroids or steroid  like substances that can cause series liver injury. Many of these bodybuilding products were labeled as   dietary supplements   in stores and online. This all came to light after the FDA received hundreds of reports of adverse reactions to some supplements.In cases like this  it can be hard for the FDA to regulate and find the sellers  especially if the products are sold only online. Retailers and websites will often change their name or relabel their products to evade authorities and scam customers  according to the FDA. Sports drink intake should be rare Sports drinks are popular  but they should be used properly. The purpose of these beverages is to provide fluid  carbohydrates (carbs) and electrolytes during long endurance events. These are times where energy stores are low  and water and electrolytes are lost in sweat. In these cases  sports drinks can support athletic performance and help with recovery. Sports drinks should not be the main source of fluid in your diet. They add extra calories  which can hinder weight goals. They also have added sodium  which may be unnecessary and can contribute to high blood pressure. If you exercise for less than an hour in a mild environment  water is the only thing you should need. It  s enough to refuel your body during exercise. A well  balanced diet and plenty of water is enough As long as athletes eat a well  balanced diet and drink plenty of water  that should be all that they need. A lot of people use products that are not scientifically sound. Some of them aren  t even regulated by the FDA. And to top it off  supplements can quickly gobble up your money. Athletes who need more carbs than the normal person are those who participate in long events  such as triathlons or marathons. But even those athletes simply need more food and liquid in their diets in the form of carbs and electrolytes to replace losses. If you  re interested in using any supplement  talk to your health care provider. You should also consider buying from companies that receive third  party testing. Checking for an NSF certification ensures the product is made with good manufacturing practices.;
Health & Fitness;Its that time of year again   Theres fresh powder in the mountains  and many of us are eager to hit the slopes. However  along with the fun of skiing or snowboarding comes the risk of injury. On average  between two and four skiers per 1 000 are injured each day on the slopes in the U.S.  according to the UC Davis Health Sports Medicine team. Injury rates are similar for snowboarding. For skiers  the good news is that improvements in technology have slightly reduced injury rates. Shaped skis have allowed people to learn faster and stay in better control. Boot  top leg fractures (facture of your tibia or fibula) are less common. But knee sprains  shoulder injuries  and thumb sprains (such as skiers thumb) still occur. For snowboarders  injuries to the wrist  shoulder  and head are most common. Snow boarders tend to reach out their hands more during a fall  since both feet are locked onto the board.To help keep you safe on the slopes  here are some tips to avoid injury   Overall fitness and regular cardio exercises can help you prevent injury. Staying in shape is important. We have a list of exercises below to help strengthen your lower body and core. Warm up your muscles before you head down the mountain. Cold muscles are at a greater risk for injury. Gently stretch your hamstrings  quadriceps (thigh muscles)  hips  and calf muscles before and after skiing or snowboarding. Wear a helmet. If you fall  a properly fitted helmet can reduce the risk of ski and snowboard head injuries. Helmets can also provide protection in the event of a collision with someone who has lost control. Staying hydrated is also important before  during  and after skiing or snowboarding. When renting or buying ski or snowboard equipment  dont overstate your skill level. Make sure you get equipment that will be safe for you and your ability. Use ski poles without straps. That will allow you to release the pole during a mishap and prevents snags that cause injuries to your thumbs and arms. Rest when youre tired. Most injuries happen after lunchtime when fatigue sets in. Wear layered clothing to keep your body warm  along with sunglasses and/or goggles to protect your eyes. While UV rays from the sun may not be as strong during the winter  sunscreen is still important because the reflection off the snow amplifies the effects of UV rays. Youre also at higher elevation  making the suns effects stronger. Snowboarders should consider wearing wrist guards to protect them when falling. There are some exercises you can do at home to keep your body in shape for winter fun. Here are some recommendations from our sports medicine team to help you avoid injuries to your lower body   Plank Start by lying on your stomach and rise onto your toes and elbows with your forearms on the ground. Keep your elbows lined up vertically with your shoulders. Tighten your glutes and make sure your belly doesnt sag  but also make sure your buttocks arent lifted in the air. Engage your whole core. Your body should look like its one straight line from your legs to your head. Switch over to a slide plank to strengthen your oblique muscles of your core. Superman stability ball On a stability ball  lie on your stomach with your toes touching the ground. Raise your upper body and put your arms straight out in front of your head. Position your entire body so its in a straight line. This exercise strengthens your entire posterior chain  or all the muscles on the backside of your body. This includes your back muscles  glutes  hamstrings  and core. Strengthening these muscles is important because they help you stay upright as you go down the slopes.;
Sports;Sports documentaries explore the human experience through the riveting world of athletics�and whether youre a die  hard fan of a particular discipline or simply love a good story  the best sports documentaries offer unforgettable insights and fascinating perspectives on the games we love. From the triumphs and tragedies of legendary athletes to the behind  the  scenes drama of iconic teams  these films capture the heart and soul of sports in a way that few othermediums can. So  get ready to get your heart rate up and maybe even be inspired with Vogues round  up of some of the best sports documentaries ever made.Whether or not you consider yourself a sports fan  you have to admit the industry has a hold on pop culture. Elite athletes  like Michael Jordan and Serena Williams  have been celebrities in their own right for decades and the ability to leverage their star status off of their respective playing fields to make them bona fide entrepreneurs has only made them more popular. And with social media  the masses now get a sense of the inner lives athletes wish to share themselves  not just the stories others wish to tell about their victories  defeats  and legacies.Those stories are high drama. Not just the kind we assume will happen on reality television these days  but a genre that spans the expanse of human emotion  from uproarious laughter to full  out sobs to seething anger. Sports is its own universe  where societal norms about the presence of emotion (or lack thereof) are turned on their head. Youll often see not only top athletes but their fans and onlookers steeped resolutely in their feelings throughout an entire match  whether its a court  pounding basketball game or the methodical strokes of golf.I was under the impression that I didnt care much about sports. But quickly after diving into documentaries around different kinds of athleticism  I realized I really do enjoy them. Im just more of a sports history girlie than someone who could be captivated by watching a game from start to finish. You might be too  so heres a list of some of the best docs out there that will help boost your sports knowledge while keeping you on the edge of your seat.Even if youve never owned a pair of Jordans  you definitely know who Michael Jordan is. And though he hasnt played for quite some time  his legacy is undeniable he went on to win six NBA championship rings with the Chicago Bulls in the early to late 90s. The crying meme that boasts his face shares just a smidge of the emotion he  his teammates  his rivals  and other notable sports figures touch upon in this ten  episode series. Prepare to be entertained  because the tea is being spilled here and its HOT. The Nancy Kerrigan versus Tonya Harding feud is undoubtedly one of sports most infamous disputes  and this installment of ESPN   30 for 30 documents how it all played out before Kerrigan was attacked. Though she doesnt give a one  on  one interview in the episode  Harding does revealing just how much there was to learn about the talented athlete before 2017s fictional profile I  Tonya sweept awards shows. This doc will take you right back to the 90s and your figure  skating obsession.;
Sports;It was a superb Hollywood face  lift. By announcing a major overhaul in its controversial documentary nominating process  the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences tried late last month to look good despite one of the most embarrassing and widely criticized episodes in its history the snubbing of Hoop Dreams  last years highly praised film about two teenage basketball hopefuls struggling to make it out of inner  city Chicago and into the pros. �I dont know that any of these changes would have made any difference at all in the outcome of nominations � Academy president Arthur Hiller said in June. And indeed  many of the changes he announced seemed benign. From now on  branches in New York and Los Angeles will split the initial viewing of contenders for nominations  and a strange seven  point scoring system will be changed to�a strange five  point scoring system. But the alterations are  in fact  intended to make certain that what happened to Hoop Dreams never happens to another film and although nobody at the Academy is using the word  Hillers own internal investigation appears to have revealed that Hoop Dreams� omission was  indeed  something of a conspiracy. The outrage began on Valentines Day  when it became clear that the perennially controversial documentary nominating committee had failed to put Dreams on the ballot. Some on the committee insisted the outcry was being drummed up to sell tickets by the films distributor  Fine Line Features. (Even without a nomination  the film earned $7.8 million $ a strong showing for a nonfiction film.) The Academys documentary committee had been losing public trust for well over a decade by disdaining most of the �breakout� nonfiction films critics adored  the roster of documentaries that were never nominated includes Shoah  28 Up  The Thin Blue Line  Roger &amp Me  Paris Is Burning  Brothers Keeper  and Truth or Dare. Each year  committee members defended their choices by insisting theyd discovered five better films. But this year  the critics went wild when Hoop Dreams and Terry Zwigoffs Crumb were denied nominations  while among the final five was Maya Lin   A Strong Clear Vision  whose director  Freida Lee Mock  had chaired the committee for the previous two years. Mocks film went on to take the award. �I call it cronyism  and this committee doesnt even understand what the word means � said Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan last March. �All of the committee members know and like Freida. Its human nature for them to have a tendency to vote for her. Theyre a cosa nostra.� Before the reforms  the committees elaborate yet primitive voting process had been to winnow down the entrants by shutting off the projector when more than half the viewing members deemed a film unworthy by shining flashlights. This year  a galaxy of penlights in the dark of the Academys stuffy third  floor screening room nixed Crumb after 55 minutes. Though the film went on to win the Sundance documentary competition and some of the years best reviews  one committee member who declined to be identified said  �Id been shining my light for a good while before that. Whats good for Sundance is not necessarily fit for us.�;
Sports;Sports  physical contests pursued for the goals and challenges they entail. Sports are part of every culture past and present  but each culture has its own definition of sports. The most useful definitions are those that clarify the relationship of sports to play  games  and contests. �Play � wrote the German theorist Carl Diem  �is purposeless activity  for its own sake  the opposite of work.� Humans work because they have to  they play because they want to. Play is autotelic�that is  it has its own goals. It is voluntary and uncoerced. Recalcitrant children compelled by their parents or teachers to compete in a game of football (soccer) are not really engaged in a sport. Neither are professional athletes if their only motivation is their paycheck. In the real world  as a practical matter  motives are frequently mixed and often quite impossible to determine. Unambiguous definition is nonetheless a prerequisite to practical determinations about what is and is not an example of play.There are at least two types of play. The first is spontaneous and unconstrained. Examples abound. A child sees a flat stone  picks it up  and sends it skipping across the waters of a pond. An adult realizes with a laugh that he has uttered an unintended pun. Neither action is premeditated  and both are at least relatively free of constraint. The second type of play is regulated. There are rules to determine which actions are legitimate and which are not. These rules transform spontaneous play into games  which can thus be defined as rule  bound or regulated play. Leapfrog  chess  �playing house � and basketball are all games  some with rather simple rules  others governed by a somewhat more complex set of regulations. In fact  the rule books for games such as basketball are hundreds of pages long.As games  chess and basketball are obviously different from leapfrog and playing house. The first two games are competitive  the second two are not. One can win a game of basketball  but it makes no sense to ask who has won a game of leapfrog. In other words  chess and basketball are contests.A final distinction separates contests into two types   those that require at least a minimum of physical skill and those that do not. Shuffleboard is a good example of the first  the board games Scrabble and Monopoly will do to exemplify the second. It must of course be understood that even the simplest sports  such as weightlifting  require a modicum of intellectual effort  while others  such as baseball  involve a considerable amount of mental alertness. It must also be understood that the sports that have most excited the passions of humankind  as participants and as spectators  have required a great deal more physical prowess than a game of shuffleboard. Through the ages  sports heroes have demonstrated awesome strength  speed  stamina  endurance  and dexterity.levels of playSports  then  can be defined as autotelic (played for their own sake) physical contests. On the basis of this definition  one can devise a simple inverted  tree diagram. Despite the clarity of the definition  difficult questions arise. Is mountain climbing a sport? It is if one understands the activity as a contest between the climber and the mountain or as a competition between climbers to be the first to accomplish an ascent. Are the drivers at the Indianapolis 500 automobile race really athletes? They are if one believes that at least a modicum of physical skill is required for winning the competition. The point of a clear definition is that it enables one to give more or less satisfactory answers to questions such as these. One can hardly understand sport if one does not begin with some conception of what sports are.;
Sports;No one can say when sports began. Since it is impossible to imagine a time when children did not spontaneously run races or wrestle  it is clear that children have always included sports in their play  but one can only speculate about the emergence of sports as autotelic physical contests for adults. Hunters are depicted in prehistoric art  but it cannot be known whether the hunters pursued their prey in a mood of grim necessity or with the joyful abandon of sportsmen. It is certain  however  from the rich literary and iconographic evidence of all ancient civilizations that hunting soon became an end in itself�at least for royalty and nobility. Archaeological evidence also indicates that ball games were common among ancient peoples as different as the Chinese and the Aztecs. If ball games were contests rather than noncompetitive ritual performances  such as the Japanese football game kemari  then they were sports in the most rigorously defined sense. That it cannot simply be assumed that they were contests is clear from the evidence presented by Greek and Roman antiquity  which indicates that ball games had been for the most part playful pastimes like those recommended for health by the Greek physician Galen in the 2nd century CE.It is unlikely that the 7th  century Islamic conquest of North Africa radically altered the traditional sports of the region. As long as wars were fought with bow and arrow  archery contests continued to serve as demonstrations of ready prowess. The prophet Muhammad specifically authorized horse races  and geography dictated that men race camels as well as horses. Hunters  too  took their pleasures on horseback.Among the many games of North Africa was ta kurt om el mahag (�the ball of the pilgrims mother�)  a Berber bat  and  ball contest whose configuration bore an uncanny resemblance to baseball. Koura  more widely played  was similar to football (soccer).Cultural variation among black Africans was far greater than among the Arab peoples of the northern littoral. Ball games were rare  but wrestling of one kind or another was ubiquitous. Wrestlings forms and functions varied from tribe to tribe. For the Nuba of southern Sudan  ritual bouts  for which mens bodies were elaborately decorated as well as carefully trained  were the primary source of male status and prestige. The Tutsi and Hutu of Rwanda were among the peoples who staged contests between females. Among the various peoples of sub  Saharan Africa  wrestling matches were a way to celebrate or symbolically encourage human fertility and the earths fecundity. In southern Nigeria  for instance  Igbo tribesmen participated in wrestling matches held every eighth day throughout the three months of the rainy season  hard  fought contests  it was thought  persuaded the gods to grant abundant harvests of corn (maize) and yams. Among the Diola of the Gambia  adolescent boys and girls wrestled (though not against one another) in what was clearly a prenuptial ceremony. Male champions were married to their female counterparts. In other tribes  such as the Yala of Nigeria  the Fon of Benin  and the Njabi of the Congo  boys and girls grappled with each other. Among the Kole  it was the kin of the bride and the bridegroom who wrestled. Stick fights  which seem to have been less closely associated with religious practices  were common among many tribes  including the Zulu and Mpondo of southern Africa.Contests for runners and jumpers were to be found across the length and breadth of the continent. During the age of imperialism  explorers and colonizers were often astonished by the prowess of these �primitive� peoples. Nandi runners of Kenyas Rift Valley seemed to run distances effortlessly at a pace that brought European runners to pitiable physical collapse. Tutsi high jumpers of Rwanda and Burundi soared to heights that might have seemed incredible had not the jumpers been photographed in flight by members of Adolf Friedrich zu Mecklenburgs anthropological expedition at the turn of the 20th century.;
Sports;Like the highly evolved civilizations of which they are a part  traditional Asian sports are ancient and various. Competitions were never as simple as they seemed to be. From the Islamic Middle East across the Indian subcontinent to China and Japan  wrestlers�mostly but not exclusively male�embodied and enacted the values of their cultures. The wrestlers strength was always more than a merely personal statement. More often than not  the men who strained and struggled understood themselves to be involved in a religious endeavour. Prayers  incantations  and rituals of purification were for centuries an important aspect of the hand  to  hand combat of Islamic wrestlers. It was not unusual to combine the skills of the wrestler with those of a mystic poet. Indeed  the celebrated 14th  century Persian pahlavan (ritual wrestler) Ma?m?d Khw?rezm? was both.Typical of the place of sport within a religious context was the spectacle of 50 sturdy Turks who wrestled in Istanbul in 1582 to celebrate the circumcision of the son of Murad III. When Indian wrestlers join an akhara (gymnasium)  they commit themselves to the quest for a holy life. As devout Hindus  they recite mantras as they do their knee bends and push  ups. In their struggle against �pollution � they strictly control their diet  sexual habits  breathing  and even their urination and defecation.While the religious aspects of Turkish and Iranian �houses of strength� (where weightlifting and gymnastics were practiced) became much less salient in the course of the 20th century  the elders in charge of Japanese sumo added a number of Shint? elements to the rituals of their sport to underscore their claim that it is a unique expression of Japanese tradition. A somewhat arbitrary distinction can be made between wrestling and the many forms of unarmed hand  to  hand combat categorized as martial arts. The emphasis of the latter is military rather than religious  instrumental rather than expressive. Chinese wushu (�military skill�)  which included armed as well as unarmed combat  was highly developed by the 3rd century BCE. Its unarmed techniques were especially prized within Chinese culture and were an important influence on the martial arts of Korea  Japan  and Southeast Asia. Much less well known in the West are varma adi (�hitting the vital spots�) and other martial arts traditions of South Asia. In the early modern era  as unarmed combat became obsolete  the emphasis of Asian martial arts tended to shift back toward religion. This shift can often be seen in the language of sports. Japanese kenjutsu (�techniques of the sword�) became kend? (�the way of the sword�).Of the armed (as opposed to unarmed) martial arts  archery was among the most important in the lives of Asian warriors from the Arabian to the Korean peninsulas. Notably  the Japanese samurai practiced many forms of archery  the most colourful of which was probably yabusame  whose mounted contestants drew their bows and loosed their arrows while galloping down a straight track some 720 to 885 feet (220 to 270 metres) long. They were required to shoot in quick succession at three small targets�each about 9 square inches (55 square cm) placed on 3  foot   (0.9  metre  ) high poles 23 to 36 feet (7 to 11 metres) from the track and spaced at intervals of 235 to 295 feet (71.5 to 90 metres). In yabusame  accuracy was paramount.In Turkey  where the composite (wood plus horn) bow was an instrument of great power  archers competed for distance. At Istanbuls Okmeydan? (�Arrow Field�)  the record was set in 1798 when Selim IIIs arrow flew more than 2 900 feet (884 metres).;
Sports;As can be seen in Mughal art of the 16th and 17th centuries  aristocratic Indians�like their counterparts throughout Asia�used their bows and arrows for hunting as well as for archery contests. Mounted hunters demonstrated equestrian as well as toxophilite skills. The Asian aristocrats passion for horses  which can be traced as far back as Hittite times  if not earlier  led not only to horse races (universal throughout Asia) but also to the development of polo and a host of similar equestrian contests. These equestrian games may in fact be the most distinctive Asian contribution to the repertory of modern sports.In all probability  polo evolved from a far rougher game played by the nomads of Afghanistan and Central Asia. In the form that survived into the 21st century  Afghan buzkashi is characterized by a dusty melee in which hundreds of mounted tribesmen fought over the headless carcass of a goat. The winner was the hardy rider who managed to grab the animal by the leg and drag it clear of the pack. Since buzkashi was clearly an inappropriate passion for a civilized monarch  polo filled the bill. Persian manuscripts from the 6th century refer to polo played during the reign of Hormuz I (271�273). The game was painted by miniaturists and celebrated by Persian poets such as Ferdows? (c. 935�c. 1020) and ??fe? (1325/26�1389/90). By 627 polo had spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and had reached China  where it became a passion among those wealthy enough to own horses. (All 16 emperors of the Tang dynasty [618�907] were polo players.) As with most sports  the vast majority of polo players were male  but the 12th  century Persian poet Ne??m? commemorated the skills of Princess Sh?r?n. Moreover  if numerous terra  cotta figures can be trusted as evidence  polo was also played by aristocratic Chinese women.There were also ball games for ordinary men and women. Played with carefully sewn stuffed skins  with animal bladders  or with found objects as simple as gourds  chunks of wood  or rounded stones  ball games are universal. Ball games of all sorts were quite popular among the Chinese. Descriptions of the game cuju  which resembled modern football (soccer)  appeared as early as the Eastern Han dynasty (25�220). Games similar to modern badminton were also played in the 1st century. Finally  the Ming dynasty (1368�1644) scroll painting Grove of Violets depicts elegantly attired ladies playing chuiwan  a game similar to modern golf.Sports were unquestionably common in ancient Egypt  where pharaohs used their hunting prowess and exhibitions of strength and skill in archery to demonstrate their fitness to rule. In such exhibitions  pharaohs such as Amenhotep II (ruled 1426�1400 BCE) never competed against anyone else  however  and there is reason to suspect that their extraordinary achievements were scribal fictions. Nonetheless  Egyptians with less claim to divinity wrestled  jumped  and engaged in ball games and stick fights. In paintings found at Beni Hassan  in a tomb dating from the Middle Kingdom (1938�c. 1630 BCE)  there are studies of 406 pairs of wrestlers demonstrating their skill.;
Sports;Since Minoan script still baffles scholars  it is uncertain whether images of Cretan boys and girls testing their acrobatic skills against bulls depict sport  religious ritual  or both. That the feats of the Cretans may have been both sport and ritual is suggested by evidence from Greece  where sports had a cultural significance unequaled anywhere else before the rise of modern sports. Secular and religious motives mingle in historys first extensive �sports report � found in Book XXIII of Homers Iliad in the form of funeral games for the dead Patroclus. These games were part of Greek religion and were not  therefore  autotelic  the contests in the Odyssey  on the other hand  were essentially secular. Odysseus was challenged by the Phaeacians to demonstrate his prowess as an athlete. In general  Greek culture included both cultic sports  such as the Olympic Games honouring Zeus  and secular contests.The most famous association of sports and religion was certainly the Olympic Games  which Greek tradition dates from 776 BCE. In the course of time  the earth goddess Gaea  originally worshiped at Olympia  was supplanted in importance by the sky god Zeus  in whose honour priestly officials conducted quadrennial athletic contests. Sacred games also were held at Delphi (in honour of Apollo)  Corinth  and Nemea. These four events were known as the periodos  and great athletes  such as Theagenes of Thasos  prided themselves on victories at all four sites. Although most of the events contested at Greek sacred games remain familiar  the most important competition was the chariot race. The extraordinary prestige accorded athletic triumphs brought with it not only literary accolades (as in the odes of Pindar) and visual commemoration (in the form of statues of the victors) but also material benefits  contrary to the amateur myth propagated by 19th  century philhellenists. Since the Greeks were devoted to secular sports as well as to sacred games  no polis  or city  state  was considered a proper community if it lacked a gymnasium where  as the word gymnos indicates  naked male athletes trained and competed. Except in militaristic Sparta  Greek women rarely participated in sports of any kind. They were excluded from the Olympic Games even as spectators (except for the priestess of Demeter). The 2nd  century  CE traveler Pausanias wrote of races for girls at Olympia  but these events in honour of Hera were of minor importance. Rome Although chariot races were among the most popular sports spectacles of the Roman and Byzantine eras  as they had been in Greek times  the Romans of the republic and the early empire were quite selectively enthusiastic about Greek athletic contests. Emphasizing physical exercises for military preparedness  an important motive in all ancient civilizations  the Romans preferred boxing  wrestling  and hurling the javelin to running footraces and throwing the discus. The historian Livy wrote of Greek athletes appearing in Rome as early as 186 BCE  however  the contestants nudity shocked Roman moralists. The emperor Augustus instituted the Actian Games in 27 BCE to celebrate his victory over Antony and Cleopatra  and several of his successors began similar games  but it was not until the later empire  especially during the reign of Hadrian (117�138 CE)  that many of the Roman elite developed an enthusiasm for Greek athletics.Greater numbers flocked to the chariot races held in Romes Circus Maximus. They were watched by as many as 250 000 spectators  five times the number that crowded into the Colosseum to enjoy gladiatorial combat. Nevertheless  there is some evidence that the latter contests were actually more popular than the former. Indeed  the munera  which pitted man against man  and the venationes  which set men against animals  became popular even in the Greek  speaking Eastern Empire  which historians once thought immune from the lust for blood. The greater frequency of chariot races can be explained in part by the fact that they were relatively inexpensive compared with the enormous costs of gladiatorial combat. The editor who staged the games usually rented the gladiators from a lanista (the manager of a troupe of gladiators) and was required to reimburse him for losers executed in response to a �thumbs down� sign. Brutal as these combats were  many of the gladiators were free men who volunteered to fight  an obvious sign of intrinsic motivation. Indeed  imperial edicts were needed to discourage the aristocracys participation. During the reign of Nero (54�68)  female gladiators were introduced into the arena.;
Sports;Cricket is the most popular sport in Pakistan. Almost all districts and neighbourhoods in Pakistan have a cricket team and people start playing from a young age. Pakistan has won international cricket events  which include the 1992 Cricket World Cup  the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy besides finishing as runner  up in the 1999 Cricket World Cup  2007 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2022 T20 World Cup. Pakistan also won the ACC Asia Cup in 2000 and 2012 and all three versions of the Austral  Asia Cup.Pakistan  s cricket teams take part in domestic competitions such as the Quaid  e  Azam Trophy  the Patron  s Trophy  ABN  AMRO Twenty  20 Cup  and the ABN  AMRO Champions Trophy. Pakistan Cricket Board also organize a franchise based T20 cricket league known as the Pakistan Super League.International Test and one  day matches are played between the Pakistan national cricket team and foreign opponents regularly. Women  s cricket is also very popular  with Kiran Baluch holding the current record for the highest score in a women  s test match with her innings of 242. The Pakistan Cricket Board controls both the men  s and women  s games. The 2020 Pakistan Super League events was hosted entirely by Pakistan. Notable cricketers from Pakistan include Aaqib Javed  Ramiz Raja  Babar Azam  Shoaib Akhtar  Younis Khan  Saqlain Mushtaq  Mushtaq Ahmed  Abdul Qadir  Wasim Akram  Zaheer Abbas  Javed Miandad  Saeed Anwar  Muhammad Yousaf  Inzamam  ul  Haq  Waqar Younis  Shahid Afridi  the Mohammad brothers (Hanif  Mushtaq  Sadiq and Wazir) and Imran Khan. Imran Khan has been named in the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Saeed Anwar  s 194 runs against India remained the record for most runs by a batsman in an ODI for 11 years which was broken by Fakhar Zaman  s 210 against Zimbabwe in 2018. Shoaib Akhtar holds the record of delivering the fastest delivery in the history of cricket. Shahid Afridi holds numerous records i.e. the 3rd fastest century in ODIs  and the highest number of sixes in international cricket. Wasim Akram at the time of his retirement had taken the most wickets in ODIs. Muhammad Yousuf has scored the most Test runs in a calendar year. The structure of domestic cricket in Pakistan at the highest level has changed many times since 1947 with the latest restructure being enforced in 2019.[16] Previously domestic cricket operated with departmental  city and regional teams    a set up encouraged by Abdul Hafeez Kardar.[17] Since 1947  the domestic first class cricket system has varied considerably per year with teams ranging from 7 to 26 and tournament matches operating under different formats (often changes occurred every year). With the advent of domestic List A and T20 forms of cricket in the 1970s and 2000s  there has been no consistent set up (as has been noted for first class cricket in Pakistan). Historically  school and club cricket has also suffered due to inconsistencies in top tier domestic cricket. The consistent changes in the domestic structure and the gradual introduction of departmental teams was encouraged as it provided permanent jobs to players. Matches were rarely televised due to lack of quality cricket and lack of interest in departmental cricket.;
Sports;The Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) is the national governing body of field hockey in Pakistan. The Pakistan Hockey Federation Women Wing (PHFWW) is the official organization of women  s field hockey in Pakistan.The Pakistan national field hockey team has won 3 gold medals at the Olympic Games  and lifted the Hockey World Cup 4 times  being the country with most World Cups till the present. It has also won the most Asian gold medals and is the only Asian team  to have won the prestigious Champions Trophy with 3 titles. It used to be consistently ranked among the top teams in the world. However  lately  there has been a decline in results  with the national team failing to qualify for both the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. The hockey team also failed to qualify for the 2023 World Cup.Also  because of the PHF  s poor economy  there were two years without any international matches between 2019 and 2021. PHF secretary lamented over lack of funding could even ban Pakistan hockey team.[40] As of December 2022 the team is ranked 16th in the world.[41] Notable players include World  Record holder Waseem Ahmad  Mohammed Saqlain  and Sohail Abbas.Pakistan national team has played in all FIH World Cup editions with the only absence coming in 2014 and 2023. The Green Shirts are also most successful national team in the Asian Games  with eight gold medals   1958  1962  1970  1974  1978  1982  1990  and 2010  the highest number of times a country has come first  and the only Asian team to have won the prestigious Champions Trophy  with three championships   1978  1980 and 1994. Pakistan has won a total of 29 official international titles to professional and grassroots level selections  with three gold medals in the Olympic Games field hockey tournaments   in Rome 1960  Mexico City 1968  and Los Angeles 1984. Pakistan is known for having fierce rivalry with India  having a record of playing each other in South Asian Games and Asian Games finals. They have competed against one another in 20 major tournaments finals so far  out of which Pakistan has won 13 titles in total. Pakistan have a record of winning the first three championships of Hockey Asia Cup in 1982  1985 and 1989 against India in row. Apart from that  Pakistan has notable competitive rivalries with Netherlands and Australia.Field hockey is the national sport of the country.[6][7] The Pakistan national team has been ranked as the #1 team in the world in both 2000 and 2001 by the FIH. Former captain Sohail Abbas holds the World Record for the most international goals scored by a player in the history of international field hockey.[8] Waseem Ahmad is the most  capped player for the team  having played 410 times between 1996 and 2013.Having played its first match in 1948  it is administered by the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF)  the governing body for hockey in Pakistan. It has been a member of the International Hockey Federation (FIH) since 1948 and was founding member of the Asian Hockey Federation (ASHF)  which was formed in 1958.;
Sports;Pakistan is known as the manufacturer of the official FIFA World Cup ball. The Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) is the governing body in Pakistan.The origin of football in Pakistan can be traced back to the mid  nineteenth century when the game was introduced during the British Raj. Initially  games were played between army teams. However  clubs were soon set up around the country.[42] One of the regional federations to organize football on what is now Pakistan Territory was the North  West India Football Association  in which clubs from the city of Lahore and the surrounding region were active.[43] Kohat FC was the first club to be established in 1930  it became the first outstation team to win the North  West India Football Championship 1937 in 1937 defeating Government College Lahore 1�0 in the finals.[43] The first female club to be established was Diya W.F.C. in 2002.Shortly after the creation of Pakistan in 1947  the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) was created  and Muhammad Ali Jinnah became its first Patron  in  Chief. PFF received recognition from FIFA in early 1948.[45] The annual National Championship was organized shortly after. In 1950  the national team gained their first international experience in Iran and Iraq.The Pakistan Football Federation Women Organizing Committee (PFFWOC) is responsible for women  s football in Pakistan. In 2004  the Pakistan Premier League was established  it is the first division of Pakistani football. The Pakistan National Football Challenge Cup is the national   knockout   cup competition in Pakistani football  run by the Pakistan Football Federation. The Pakistan National Women  s Football Championship is the annual women  s championship. Australian Rules Football See also   Australian rules football in Asia Australian rules football was established in Pakistan in 2014 with support from the Australian High Commission.[47] The governing body is the Australian Rules Football Federation of Pakistan. Teams were established in Islamabad  Rawalpindi  Multan  and Gujranwala.[47] It is currently strongest in the Swat Valley  where a large competition operates and draws large enthusiastic crowds. A women  s team was formed in 2017. A major national tournament was organized in 2018.[48] Australia sent a coach to assist Pakistan in 2019 however the sport  s rapid growth in popularity was greatly outpacing local officials ability to support it.[49] 10 of Pakistan  s more than 15 clubs contested the 2021 AFL Pakistan National Championships in Islamabad. Pakistan sent a team to the Asian Championship in 2022  however met some roadblocks to participation due to funding.[51] Despite challenges sending a team  it won the Division 3 title.[52] In 2022 AFL Asia reported that Pakistan was the largest and fastest growing nation for the sport in Asia with over 5 000 players with a 45% annual increase in participation.[53] The Pakistan national side are known as the Dragoons.Upon Pakistan  s independence in 1947  both East and West wings of the country inherited the football infrastructure of the British Raj.[3][4] The need for establishing a nationwide football association to govern the game properly was urgent  since India had inherited the erstwhile Calcutta  based Indian Football Association and the All  India Football Federation (AIFF). As games  chess and basketball are obviously different from leapfrog and playing house. The first two games are competitive  the second two are not. One can win a game of basketball  but it makes no sense to ask who has won a game of leapfrog. In other words  chess and basketball are contests.;
Sports;n 2006  Pakistan Federation Baseball hosted the 7th Asian Baseball Championship [54] and again from 2010 through 2017  with the national team winning the tournament from 2010 through 2015.The Pakistan national baseball team is the national team representing Pakistan in international baseball tournaments and competitions. The team is controlled and governed by the Pakistan Federation Baseball  which is represented in the Baseball Federation of Asia (BFA)  having been ranked #5 in Asia  just behind China.[2] They are ranked as the top and one of the most successful baseball teams in South Asia  winning the first SAARC Baseball Championship 8�2 against Sri Lanka in 2011.[3] As of 2023  Pakistan is currently ranked 38th in the world by the World Baseball Softball Confederation.The Pakistani team has participated in many of the international and regional tournaments and has achieved many successes. It has won the Asian Baseball Championship (C level) title in 2010  where they won 10�0 against Hong Kong in the final round [4] and five titles at the Asian Baseball Cup  winning the last tournament in 2015.[5] The team qualified for the World Baseball Classic qualifier round for the first time where they lost 0�10 against Brazil and 0�14 while competing against Great Britain in 2016.Like in almost every South Asian country where baseball is a minor sport  Pakistan  s most popular sport is cricket  which diverts athletic talent away from baseball. As of 2023  Pakistan has never qualified for the World Baseball Classic.Pakistan have participated at the Asian Baseball Championship since 2003  and have competed in the competition ever since. The national team has struggled in competing against top Asian teams such as Japan  Chinese Taipei  and South Korea  among others. Pakistan secured fifth position after coming victorious against Indonesia in the 2015 Asian Baseball Championship.Pakistan have dominated the Asian Baseball Cup since its inception  and have competed in every year. Since 1997  Pakistan have never missed out on placing in the top 3 in any tournament  and is the only team to have achieved this feat. Pakistan also holds the record for most consecutive Asian Baseball Cup titles  having won five times in total  while the national team have been defending their title since the last four tournaments.The Asian Baseball Championship is the main championship tournament between national baseball teams in Asia  governed by the Baseball Federation of Asia (BFA).[1] [2] It is held every other year in odd  numbered years and since 1983 it also functions as the qualification games for the Baseball at the Summer Olympics if the event year is exactly one year before the Olympics.[3] In even  numbered years  the Asian Baseball Cup is held  to determine two qualifiers one from the Eastern Division and one from the Western Division to join teams from China  Taiwan  Japan  and South Korea. The competition has been dominated by teams from Japan  South Korea and Taiwan.As games  chess and basketball are obviously different from leapfrog and playing house.

Sports;Pakistan has an ice hockey team but it is not part of the IIHF. Pakistan applied for membership but the congress postponed it until it had a better structure. However  Pakistan has deep roots in ice hockey in the northern parts of   Glgit  Baltistan province. Pakistan  s first hockey game was played in Naltar The first hockey game in Pakistan took place in December 2018 in Naltar between the Pakistan Air Force and Gilgit Scouts.[56] Baltistan Ice Hockey Championship 2022 was held in Skardu on January 25  26  with teams named after glaciers  to raise awareness about climate change.The Pakistani team has participated in many of the international and regional tournaments and has achieved many successes. It has won the Asian Baseball Championship (C level) title in 2010  where they won 10�0 against Hong Kong in the final round [4] and five titles at the Asian Baseball Cup  winning the last tournament in 2015.[5] The team qualified for the World Baseball Classic qualifier round for the first time where they lost 0�10 against Brazil and 0�14 while competing against Great Britain in 2016.The latest landmark for Pakistan rugby is that universities like Lahore University of Management and Sciences (LUMS) and Bahria University Islamabad have formed teams as well.The game though remained mainly an expatriate sport  with KRFU being active on the All  India circuit up till the late fifties.[2] Records of teams containing Pakistani players exist going back to the 1950s  with an East Pakistan Rifles team beating Chittagong Rugby Club on 2 July 1955 at Niaz Stadium.

Reay.[3] The sixties saw a decrease in the expatriate population and travel to India becoming more regulated  therefore the club became more reliant on playing fixtures with visiting British Navy Ships  at a time when Karachi had become a regular port of call for R&R and supplies.[2] In 1968�1969 a handful of local players were introduced into the club   this would prove to be the saving grace for the game in the country. By the mid seventies the British Navy reduced its presence in the Indian Ocean and port visits became infrequent  and by the early eighties Rugby had become almost non  existent. The Karachi Rugby Football Union continued to play  yet due to limited funds it was unable to travel abroad for matches and suffered from lack of opposing teams to play within the country.;
Sports;Handball was first played in 1984 in an exhibition event  and was taken up by the Pakistan Olympic Association. The Pakistan Handball Federation is a member of the Asia Handball Federation. In beach handball  Pakistan is ranked first in Asia.3rd World Beach Handball Championship held from 9 to 13 July 2008 in Cadiz  Spain. Pakistan obtained 5th position and qualified for the World Games. Pakistan Handball team won one Gold medal in the 11th South Asian Games 2010  Dhaka  Bangladesh. Pakistan obtained one silver medal during IHF Challenge Trophy 2010 held in Dhaka.[55] Pakistan also participated in the Beach Handball World Cup in 2008. Pakistan won the gold medal at the first Beach Asian Games in Bali  Indonesia.Pakistan Handball Federation is the administrative and controlling body for handball and beach handball in Islamic Republic of Pakistan. PHF is an affiliated member of the Asian Handball Federation (AHF) and the International Handball Federation.In Pakistan  sport of handball was introduced by Muhammad Shafiq in 1984 at University of Agriculture  Faisalabad  which is hub of handball in Pakistan since then. During the 20th National Games of Pakistan which was staged in Faisalabad  an exhibition match between National Athletics & Fitness Club and University of Agriculture  Faisalabad was played at Iqbal Stadium  Faisalabad. Since then  handball has been gradually developing and gaining popularity. PHF was formed in April 1985 with Ahsan Alam as President and Muhammad Shafiq as secretary general.Modern handball is played on a court of 40 by 20 metres (131 by 66 ft)  with a goal in the middle of each end. The goals are surrounded by a 6  metre (20 ft) zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed  goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while   diving   into it. The sport is usually played indoors  but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball  Czech handball (which were more common in the past) and beach handball. The game is fast and high  scoring   professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each  though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago. Body contact is permitted for the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal. No protective equipment is mandated  but players may wear soft protective bands  pads and mouth guards.The modern set of rules was published in 1917 by Karl Schelenz  Max Heiser  and Erich Konigh [5] on 29 October in Berlin  which is seen as the date of birth of the sport.[1][6] The rules have had several revisions since. The first official handball match was played in 1917 in Germany.[1] Karl Schelenz modified the rules in 1919.[5] The first international games were played (under these rules) with men in 1925 (between Germany and Belgium) and with women in 1930 (between Germany and Austria).;a

The latest landmark for Pakistan rugby is that universities like Lahore University of Management and Sciences (LUMS) and Bahria University Islamabad have formed teams as well.The Pakistan Rugby Union was formally established in 2000[1] and gained membership with the Asian Rugby Football Union in 2000. Pakistan Rugby Union then became an associate member of the IRB (International Rugby Board) in November 2003. Rugby has now been introduced at the Provincial and District level by the Pakistan Rugby Union. Schools have also been targeted for rugby to be introduced at the grass root level.Pakistani rugby goes as far back as 1926 when the Karachi Rugby Football Union was formed.[2] The game though remained mainly an expatriate sport  with KRFU being active on the All  India circuit up till the late fifties.[2] Records of teams containing Pakistani players exist going back to the 1950s  with an East Pakistan Rifles team beating Chittagong Rugby Club on 2 July 1955 at Niaz Stadium. Chittagong was made up from European players  while the Rifles were all Pakistani apart from their coach J.M. Reay.[3] The sixties saw a decrease in the expatriate population and travel to India becoming more regulated  therefore the club became more reliant on playing fixtures with visiting British Navy Ships  at a time when Karachi had become a regular port of call for R&R and supplies.[2] In 1968�1969 a handful of local players were introduced into the club   this would prove to be the saving grace for the game in the country. By the mid seventies the British Navy reduced its presence in the Indian Ocean and port visits became infrequent  and by the early eighties Rugby had become almost non  existent. The Karachi Rugby Football Union continued to play  yet due to limited funds it was unable to travel abroad for matches and suffered from lack of opposing teams to play within the country.The interest in rugby was rejuvenated in the nineties by a combination of passion and commitment of the locals who had been introduced to the game in the seventies and resurgence in the expatriate presence. Whilst some experienced local players established clubs in Lahore and Karachi  staff from foreign embassies  commissions and banks  consisting of Frenchmen  British  and some Americans  established a club in Islamabad. 1992 onwards has seen regular fixtures between teams from these cities. By the mid  nineties an Islamabad club called the Islamabad Rugby Football Club  consisting mainly of local players had also been established in addition to the side made up of expatriates  the latter passes through phases of dormancy subject to postings and availability of players. Lahore Rugby Football Club which was formed around the same time became their main competitors.;
