Health & Fitness;Why is exercise so important for seniors? Whether you were once much more physically active or have never been one to exercise regularly now is a great time to start an exercise and fitness regimen. Getting and staying in shape is just as important for seniors as it is for younger people. Why is exercise important for older people? Getting your heart rate up and challenging your muscles benefits virtually every system in your body and improves your physical and mental health in myriad ways. Physical activity helps maintain a healthy blood pressure keeps harmful plaque from building up in your arteries reduces inflammation improves blood sugar levels strengthens bones and helps stave off depression. In addition a regular exercise program can make your sex life better lead to better quality sleep reduce your risk of some cancers and is linked to longer life. Many older adults hesitate to get moving because theyre unfamiliar with the types of exercise and fitness that are effective and safe and arent sure how much exercise they need to do. The good news is that any kind of movement is better than being sedentary so theres nothing wrong with starting small and working your way up to longer workouts. Your goal should be no less than 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week but if you cant start at that level work up to it (and then past it). While there are many dedicated forms of exercise and fitness for adults you also want to stay physically active throughout the day by taking the stairs doing yard work and playing with your grandkids. When it comes to exercise and fitness for seniors most can begin without consulting a doctorbut there are exceptions. If you have a major health condition like diabetes high blood pressure heart or lung disease osteoprosis or a neurological disease definitely talk to your doctor first. People with mobility issues such as poor balance or arthritis should also get advice from their doctor. What are the best types of exercise? While there are endless forms of exercise experts categorize physical activity into four broad types based on what each calls upon your body to do and how the movement benefits you. Aerobic exercise is marked by an increased heart rate. Although most aerobic exercises require you to move your whole body the main focus is on your heart and lungs (Aerobic exercise is often called cardio because it challenges and benefits your cardiovascular system). Activities like walking swimming dancing and cycling if done at sufficient intensity get you breathing faster and your heart working harder. Aerobic exercises burn fat improve your mood reduce inflammation and lower blood sugar. Strength training sometimes called resistance training should be performed two to three times a week. Squats lunges push-ups and the exercises performed on resistance machines or using weights or bands help maintain and even build muscle mass and strength. Strength training also helps prevent falls keep bones strong lower blood sugar levels and improve balance. Do a combination of both isometric and isotonic exercises. Isometric exercises such as doing planks and holding leg lifts are done without movement. They are great for maintaining strength and improving stability. Isotonic exercises require you to bear weight throughout a range of motion. Bicep curls bench presses and sit-ups are all forms of isotonic exercise. Stretching exercises keep your muscles and tendons flexible preserve your posture and improve mobility especially as you age. Stretching can be done every day. Balance exercises call on the various systems that help you stay upright and oriented such as those of the inner ear vision and muscles and joints. Tai chi and yoga are great forms of balance exercises that can help you avoid falls and stay independent well into your senior years.
Health & Fitness;What if my exercise ability is limited? Everyone can and should do some form of exercise even if they face severe limitations. Experts have designed specific exercises for seniors that are low-impact safe and able to be done even from a sitting position if necessary. If youre concerned about fall risk balance exercises for seniors can be done holding onto a chair or doorframe. For example standing behind a chair you can hold its back and lift one leg to about the height of the middle of the calf of the other leg while tightening your abdominal muscles. As you progress you might try holding the chair with just one hand and eventually letting go of the chair. Even core-strengthening exercises for seniors can be adapted to those with limited abilities. For example a standard plank is done by holding yourself parallel to the floor with only your forearms and toes touching the mat. An easier version allows you to also place your knees on the mat. But a still easier method is to do the plank while standing and leaning forward. You put your elbows and forearms on a desk table or wall while resting on the balls of your feet and keeping your back straight. There are a variety of stretching exercises for seniors to suit people of different abilities. If holding poses on your hands and knees is out of the question you could try a full-body stretch in which you lie on your back straighten your legs and extend your hands along the floor past your head. Some stretches can be done while seated such as overhead stretches and neck rotations. In fact other types of exercise also can be done from a seated position. Other chair exercises for seniors include bicep curls (with dumbbells or elastic bands) overhead dumbbell presses shoulder blade squeezes calf raises sit-to-stands (chair squats) and knee extensions. What exercises are best for heart health? The best exercise program will incorporate both aerobic and strength training since thats the best way to strengthen your entire body improve your endurance and ensure your long-term health. But if your main concern is how to improve cardiovascular health then you should put a premium on cardiovascular exercises that force your heart and lungs to work harder sending oxygen to your cells. While strength training certainly does have cardiovascular benefits cardio workouts excel when it comes to reducing blood pressure maintaining the health of the inner walls of your arteries releasing enzymes that break down blood clots and even promoting the growth of new arteries feeding the heart. Regular aerobic exercise also significantly lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes. Although diabetes usually isnt thought of as a heart problem a lower risk of diabetes also lowers the risk of heart disease since high blood sugar takes a toll on blood vessels and the nerves that control the heart. When you exercise you call on your bodys cells to take glucose (sugar) out of the blood which they do by becoming more sensitive to insulin the hormone crucial to glucose metabolism. That means your cells remain insulin-sensitive long after youre finished exercising. And since obesity is a significant risk for diabetes exercises that help you shed fatespecially around your middlewill help you keep diabetes at bay.
Health & Fitness;How much exercise do I need? How much exercise you should be getting depends on several factors including your current level of fitness your fitness goals the types of exercise youre planning to do and whether you have deficits in such areas as strength flexibility or balance. As a general rule 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity (or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise) is recommended as a weekly minimum. As you become more fit youll want to exceed that in order to reap maximum benefit. A natural way of splitting up the 150 minutes might be to do a 30-minute session five times per week or you can break it up and do two 15-minute sessions during a single day. Adopt whatever schedule fits your lifestyle.For strength exercises aim to work all your major muscle groups twice to three times each week leaving 48 hours between each workout for recovery. If you do total-body workouts thats two sessions per week. If you choose to split your workouts to target a specific muscle group (e.g. leg day) that will require more frequent workouts. Just make sure youre leaving 48 hours of rest before you re-work a major muscle. If you have noticed problems with your balance such as unsteadiness dizziness or vertigo talk to a healthcare provider for recommendations about balance-specific exercises. Get in three half-hour workouts each week in addition to a 30-minute walk at least twice weekly.Its best to stretch after you have warmed up for a few minutes or perform stretching exercises after you completed your workout. When stretching each muscle group take it slow and steady release repeat again. But how much exercise is too much? You should expect a little muscle soreness after workouts especially in the beginning. But if you find that your body is simply not recovering between workouts you may be overtraining. Remember that seniors need more recovery time than younger people. With the exception of welcome muscle soreness an exercise program should make you feel good. If it doesnt youre probably overdoing it. That doesnt mean you should quit only that you should dial back the intensity or frequency of your workouts until you hit the sweet spot in which youve tired out your body but then recovered enough to tackle your next session with enthusiasm.What are the benefits of exercise?A smartly designed exercise program will benefit your body and mind in innumerable ways.The benefits of exercise on mental health are well documented. For example one major study found that sedentary people are 44% more likely to be depressed. Another found that those with mild to moderate depression could get similar results to those obtained through antidepressants just by exercising for 90 minutes each week. The key appears to be the release of brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine which help lift mood and combat stress.Were all familiar with exercises ability to improve cardiovascular health. But how does exercise lower blood pressure? Interestingly when you stimulate your circulatory system through aerobic exercise youre temporarily increasing your blood pressure by forcing the system to work harderbut when youve finished exercising your blood pressure drops to a lower level than it was before you began.Many people think of exercise as an integral part of weight lossand although diet is also extremely important theyre not wrong. But what exercise burns the most calories? Generally aerobic exercises (cardio) are great for expending calories and reducing fat. But dont overlook the effectiveness of strength training which optimizes your bodys ratio of lean muscle to fat (Its also the best exercise for bone strength). Theres no Holy Grail when it comes to a single best weight-loss exercise. The best exercise to lose weight is the one youll do consistently. Whatever gets your heart rate up and gets your body movingwhile having fun and staying motivatedis the exercise that will help you shed pounds.

So dont let a busy schedule at work home or school be an excuse to avoid activity. Get moving whenever you can find the timeyour mind and body will thank you! Overcoming obstacles to exercise Even when you know that exercise will help you feel better taking that first step is still easier said than done. Obstacles to exercising are very realparticularly when youre also struggling with a mental health issue. Here are some common barriers and how you can get past them. Feeling exhausted. When youre tired depressed or stressed it seems that working out will just make you feel worse. But the truth is that physical activity is a powerful energizer. Studies show that regular exercise can dramatically reduce fatigue and increase your energy levels. If you are really feeling tired promise yourself a quick 5-minute walk. Chances are once you get moving youll have more energy and be able to walk for longer.Feeling overwhelmed. When youre stressed or depressed the thought of adding another obligation to your busy daily schedule can seem overwhelming. Working out just doesnt seem practical. If you have children finding childcare while you exercise can also be a big hurdle. However if you begin thinking of physical activity as a priority (a necessity for your mental well-being) youll soon find ways to fit small amounts of exercise into even the busiest schedule.
Health & Fitness;Feeling hopeless. Even if youve never exercised before you can still find ways to comfortably get active. Start slow with easy low-impact activities a few minutes each day such as walking or dancing. Feeling bad about yourself. Are you your own worst critic? Its time to try a new way of thinking about your body. No matter your weight age or fitness level there are plenty of others in the same boat. Ask a friend to exercise with you. Accomplishing even the smallest fitness goals will help you gain body confidence and improve how you think about yourself. Feeling pain. If you have a disability severe weight problem arthritis or any injury or illness that limits your mobility talk to your doctor about ways to safely exercise. You shouldnt ignore pain but rather do what you can when you can. Divide your exercise into shorter more frequent chunks of time if that helps or try exercising in water to reduce joint or muscle discomfort. Getting started with exercise when you have a mental health issue Many of us find it hard enough to motivate ourselves to exercise at the best of times. But when you feel depressed anxious stressed or have another mental health problem it can seem doubly difficult. This is especially true of depression and anxiety which can leave you feeling trapped in a catch-22 situation. You know exercise will make you feel better but depression has robbed you of the energyand motivation you need to work out or your social anxiety means you cant bear the thought of being seen at an exercise class or running through the park. Start small. When youre under the cloud of anxiety or depression and havent exercised for a long time setting extravagant goals like completing a marathon or working out for an hour every morning will only leave you more despondent if you fall short. Better to set achievable goals and build up from there.Schedule workouts when your energy is highest. Perhaps you have most energy first thing in the morning before work or school or at lunchtime before the mid-afternoon lull hits? Or maybe you do better exercising for longer at the weekends. If depression or anxiety has you feeling tired and unmotivated all day long try dancing to some music or simply going for a walk. Even a short 15-minute walk can help clear your mind improve your mood and boost your energy level. As you move and start to feel a little better youll often boost your energy enough to exercise more vigorouslyby walking further breaking into a run or adding a bike ride for example.Focus on activities you enjoy. Any activity that gets you moving counts. That could include throwing a Frisbee with a dog or friend walking laps of a mall window shopping or cycling to the grocery store. If youve never exercised before or dont know what you might enjoy try a few different things. Activities such as gardening or tackling a home improvement project can be great ways to start moving more when you have a mood disorderas well as helping you become more active they can also leave you with a sense of purpose and accomplishment.
Health & Fitness;Be comfortable. Wear clothing thats comfortable and choose a setting that you find calming or energizing. That may be a quiet corner of your home a scenic path or your favorite city park.Reward yourself. Part of the reward of completing an activity is how much better youll feel afterwards but it always helps your motivation to promise yourself an extra treat for exercising. Reward yourself with a hot bubble bath after a workout a delicious smoothie or with an extra episode of your favorite TV show for example.Make exercise a social activity. Exercising with a friend or loved one or even your kids will not only make exercising more fun and enjoyable it can also help motivate you to stick to a workout routine. Youll also feel better than if you were exercising alone. In fact when youre suffering from a mood disorder such as depression the companionship can be just as important as the exercise.Easy ways to move more that dont involve the gym Dont have a 30-minute block of time to dedicate to yoga or a bike ride? Dont worry. Think about physical activity as a lifestyle rather than just a single task to check off your to-do list. Look at your daily routine and consider ways to sneak in activity here there and everywhere. Move in and around your home. Clean the house wash the car tend to the yard and garden mow the lawn with a push mower sweep the sidewalk or patio with a broom. Sneak activity in at work or on the go. Bike or walk to an appointment rather than drive use stairs instead of elevators briskly walk to the bus stop then get off one stop early park at the back of the lot and walk into the store or office or take a vigorous walk during your coffee break. Get active with the family. Jog around the soccer field during your kids practice make a neighborhood bike ride part of your weekend routine play tag with your children in the yard go canoeing at a lake walk the dog in a new place.

However if they arent done properly these workouts can lead to muscle and joint injuries.Before you think about starting high-intensity exercise be sure youre able to do it safely. Our sports medicine team has some guidance and effective alternatives.What is an example of a high-intensity workout? High-intensity interval training better known as HIIT consists of short bursts of intense work that typically last between 15 seconds to 4 minutes. These are followed by a quick recovery period and then right back to the tough work. These cycles are repeated several times and can include a variety of exercises in each round. HIIT workouts can include the use of a stationary bike treadmill bodyweight kettlebell dumbbells or jump rope. Another type of HIIT workout you may have heard of is called Tabata.What are the benefits of HIIT or other high-intensity exercises? HIIT and other high-intensity exercise programs help you burn a lot of calories in a short amount of time. Research has also showed that you keep burning calories for hours after your workout is finished. These workouts typically cause you to burn more fat and build muscle. Studies have also showed that high-intensity workouts may help lower blood pressure and heart rate.Can high-intensity exercise really be dangerous? The short answer is yes. However the biggest danger to health is an inactive lifestyle which is much more widespread than overdoing exercise. The goal should be to slowly overload the body for higher levels of performance rather than to suddenly increase activity levels. While high-intensity exercise can lead to overuse injuries or muscle and joint injuries these are less likely to occur with the right preparation.Are there any fitness trends that concern you? Any of the all-out group workouts that emphasize intensity instead of proper form and preparation can be a problem. These include programs that push you to do more sets and repetitions with heavier weights than youre comfortable with. Exercise should make you feel some burn in your muscles but it should never be painful. Our UC Davis Health sports medicine physicians treat a lot of injuries related to these types of programs. Intensity can be great when done correctly. Too much too soon is likely to cause problems.Why is it a problem for an inactive or casual fitness person to do intense fitness activities? The biggest issue is that moving regularly isnt something most people do. This can leave people who try to get in shape quickly more prone to injury.Inactive people who arent experienced with exercise or those who havent regularly exercised in a while tend to push themselves too much. In these situations people often arent aware of how hard they can and should work. This is especially true for those who are doing a group workout. Can high-intensity exercise improve fitness? There are ways to mix in intensity and speed fitness but that should not be the emphasis for most people. Start by moving more than you normally do throughout each day. This is more beneficial than a one tough workout every so often. At the same time people who have been doing the same exercises for months are unlikely to get more fit unless they make changes. This could include changing their routines pushing harder and working beyond their comfort zones. What are some signs that youve gone too far with a workout? Pain is a big sign that a workout is causing trouble. If any exercise causes pain dont push through it. Its a good idea to start slowly increasing physical activity and intensity. This will allow you to learn the difference between pain and being uncomfortable.
Health & Fitness;Athletes have an ever-expanding variety of pills powders drinks and other tools to choose from that promise to make them faster stronger and bigger.Sales figures indicate that many athletes and fitness gurus have bought into that promise. But it's largely an empty one. Performance supplements should not be a substitute for healthy nutrition and drinking water.Research on exercise supplements There's no scientific evidence to support products that claim they'll increase muscle size strength energy or athletic performance. But many athletes look for any way to gain an edge on their competition or quickly reach their personal goals.People are often swayed by clever marketing techniques videos on social media or professional athletes who endorse nutritional supplements. Often experts who aren't qualified or don't have a background in nutrition make inaccurate claims about these products.Because there is no standard for many of these supplements it can be common to find several different chemical formulas depending on the company. Each one claims it contains the same vital compound.Safety information on protein supplements Supplements for amino acids the building blocks for protein are promoted as helping build muscle. However the average American diet already has two-to-three times more protein than is needed. It's also important to note that high levels of specific amino acids can potentially produce a toxic effect. It can place an extra burden on your kidneys and contribute to kidney failure in the long-term. Unnecessarily adding individual vitamins and minerals into your diet can also create imbalances within your body. This can lead to major changes or long-term health effects. Unnecessary supplements can be potentially toxic and may reduce your body's ability to absorb other nutrients.One example comes from a 2022 report released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The report included information that some bodybuilding products posed serious health risks. The FDA found that some products that claimed to help build muscle mass and strength illegally contained steroids or steroid-like substances that can cause series liver injury. Many of these bodybuilding products were labeled as dietary supplements in stores and online. This all came to light after the FDA received hundreds of reports of adverse reactions to some supplements.In cases like this it can be hard for the FDA to regulate and find the sellers especially if the products are sold only online. Retailers and websites will often change their name or relabel their products to evade authorities and scam customers according to the FDA. Sports drink intake should be rare Sports drinks are popular but they should be used properly. The purpose of these beverages is to provide fluid carbohydrates (carbs) and electrolytes during long endurance events. These are times where energy stores are low and water and electrolytes are lost in sweat. In these cases sports drinks can support athletic performance and help with recovery. Sports drinks should not be the main source of fluid in your diet. They add extra calories which can hinder weight goals. They also have added sodium which may be unnecessary and can contribute to high blood pressure. If you exercise for less than an hour in a mild environment water is the only thing you should need. It's enough to refuel your body during exercise. A well-balanced diet and plenty of water is enough As long as athletes eat a well-balanced diet and drink plenty of water that should be all that they need. A lot of people use products that are not scientifically sound. Some of them aren't even regulated by the FDA. And to top it off supplements can quickly gobble up your money. Athletes who need more carbs than the normal person are those who participate in long events such as triathlons or marathons. But even those athletes simply need more food and liquid in their diets in the form of carbs and electrolytes to replace losses. If you're interested in using any supplement talk to your health care provider. You should also consider buying from companies that receive third-party testing. Checking for an NSF certification ensures the product is made with good manufacturing practices.
Health & Fitness;Its that time of year again: Theres fresh powder in the mountains and many of us are eager to hit the slopes. However along with the fun of skiing or snowboarding comes the risk of injury. On average between two and four skiers per 1 000 are injured each day on the slopes in the U.S. according to the UC Davis Health Sports Medicine team. Injury rates are similar for snowboarding. For skiers the good news is that improvements in technology have slightly reduced injury rates. Shaped skis have allowed people to learn faster and stay in better control. Boot-top leg fractures (facture of your tibia or fibula) are less common. But knee sprains shoulder injuries and thumb sprains (such as skiers thumb) still occur. For snowboarders injuries to the wrist shoulder and head are most common. Snow boarders tend to reach out their hands more during a fall since both feet are locked onto the board.To help keep you safe on the slopes here are some tips to avoid injury: Overall fitness and regular cardio exercises can help you prevent injury. Staying in shape is important. We have a list of exercises below to help strengthen your lower body and core. Warm up your muscles before you head down the mountain. Cold muscles are at a greater risk for injury. Gently stretch your hamstrings quadriceps (thigh muscles) hips and calf muscles before and after skiing or snowboarding. Wear a helmet. If you fall a properly fitted helmet can reduce the risk of ski and snowboard head injuries. Helmets can also provide protection in the event of a collision with someone who has lost control. Staying hydrated is also important before during and after skiing or snowboarding. When renting or buying ski or snowboard equipment dont overstate your skill level. Make sure you get equipment that will be safe for you and your ability. Use ski poles without straps. That will allow you to release the pole during a mishap and prevents snags that cause injuries to your thumbs and arms. Rest when youre tired. Most injuries happen after lunchtime when fatigue sets in. Wear layered clothing to keep your body warm along with sunglasses and/or goggles to protect your eyes. While UV rays from the sun may not be as strong during the winter sunscreen is still important because the reflection off the snow amplifies the effects of UV rays. Youre also at higher elevation making the suns effects stronger. Snowboarders should consider wearing wrist guards to protect them when falling. There are some exercises you can do at home to keep your body in shape for winter fun. Here are some recommendations from our sports medicine team to help you avoid injuries to your lower body: Plank Start by lying on your stomach and rise onto your toes and elbows with your forearms on the ground. Keep your elbows lined up vertically with your shoulders. Tighten your glutes and make sure your belly doesnt sag but also make sure your buttocks arent lifted in the air. Engage your whole core. Your body should look like its one straight line from your legs to your head. Switch over to a slide plank to strengthen your oblique muscles of your core. Superman stability ball On a stability ball lie on your stomach with your toes touching the ground. Raise your upper body and put your arms straight out in front of your head. Position your entire body so its in a straight line. This exercise strengthens your entire posterior chain or all the muscles on the backside of your body. This includes your back muscles glutes hamstrings and core. Strengthening these muscles is important because they help you stay upright as you go down the slopes.
